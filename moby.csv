40	Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions,
41	all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States, unless a
42	copyright notice is included.  Therefore, we usually do NOT keep any
43	of these books in compliance with any particular paper edition.
44	
45	
46	We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
47	of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
48	
49	Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
50	midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
51	The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
52	Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
53	preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
54	and editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an
55	up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
56	in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has
57	a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
58	look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
59	new copy has at least one byte more or less.

62	Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)
63	
64	We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
65	time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
66	to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
67	searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
68	projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
69	per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
70	million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-six text
71	files per month, or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000+
72	If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
73	total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year.
74	
75	The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
76	Files by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]
77	This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
78	which is only ~5% of the present number of computer users.
79	
80	At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
81	of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we
82	manage to get some real funding; currently our funding is mostly
83	from Michael Hart's salary at Carnegie-Mellon University, and an
84	assortment of sporadic gifts; this salary is only good for a few
85	more years, so we are looking for something to replace it, as we
86	don't want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person.
87	
88	We need your donations more than ever!

146	Why is this Small Print! statement here?  You know: lawyers.
147	They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
148	your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
149	someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
150	fault.  So, among other things, this Small Print! statement
151	disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
152	you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.
153	
154	*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT

163	ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
164	This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
165	tm etexts, is a public domain work distributed by Professor
166	Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
167	Carnegie-Mellon University (the Project).  Among other
168	things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
169	on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
170	distribute it in the United States without permission and
171	without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
172	below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
173	under the Project's PROJECT GUTENBERG trademark.
174	
175	To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
176	efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
177	works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
178	medium they may be on may contain Defects.  Among other
179	things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
180	corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
181	intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
182	disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
183	codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.
184	
185	LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
186	But for the Right of Replacement or Refund described below,
187	[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
188	etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
189	liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
190	legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR

194	POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
195	
196	If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
197	receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
198	you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
199	time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
200	on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
201	such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
202	copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
203	choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
204	receive it electronically.
205	
206	THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU AS-IS.  NO OTHER
207	WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS

294	Notes on this etext of Moby Dick:
295	
296	This text is a combination of etexts, one from the now-defunct ERIS
297	project at Virginia Tech and one from Project Gutenberg's archives.
298	The proofreaders of this version are indebted to The University of
299	Adelaide Library for preserving the Virginia Tech version.  The
300	resulting etext was compared with a public domain hard copy version of
301	the text.
302	
303	In chapters 24, 89, and 90, we substituted a capital L for the symbol
304	for the British pound, a unit of currency.

319	(Supplied by a Late Consumptive Usher to a Grammar School)
320	
321	The pale Usher--threadbare in coat, heart, body, and brain; I see him
322	now.  He was ever dusting his old lexicons and grammars, with a queer
323	handkerchief, mockingly embellished with all the gay flags of all the
324	known nations of the world.  He loved to dust his old grammars; it
325	somehow mildly reminded him of his mortality.
326	
327	"While you take in hand to school others, and to teach them by what
name a whale-fish is to be called in our tongue leaving out, through
ignorance, the letter H, which almost alone maketh the signification
of the word, you deliver that which is not true. --HACKLUYT"

350	EXTRACTS (Supplied by a Sub-Sub-Librarian).
351	
352	It will be seen that this mere painstaking burrower and grub-worm of
353	a poor devil of a Sub-Sub appears to have gone through the long
354	Vaticans and street-stalls of the earth, picking up whatever random
355	allusions to whales he could anyways find in any book whatsoever,
356	sacred or profane.  Therefore you must not, in every case at least,
357	take the higgledy-piggledy whale statements, however authentic, in
358	these extracts, for veritable gospel cetology.  Far from it.  As
359	touching the ancient authors generally, as well as the poets here
360	appearing, these extracts are solely valuable or entertaining, as
361	affording a glancing bird's eye view of what has been promiscuously
362	said, thought, fancied, and sung of Leviathan, by many nations and
363	generations, including our own.
364	
365	So fare thee well, poor devil of a Sub-Sub, whose commentator I am.
366	Thou belongest to that hopeless, sallow tribe which no wine of this
367	world will ever warm; and for whom even Pale Sherry would be too
368	rosy-strong; but with whom one sometimes loves to sit, and feel
369	poor-devilish, too; and grow convivial upon tears; and say to them
370	bluntly, with full eyes and empty glasses, and in not altogether
371	unpleasant sadness--Give it up, Sub-Subs!  For by how much the more
372	pains ye take to please the world, by so much the more shall ye for
373	ever go thankless!  Would that I could clear out Hampton Court and
374	the Tuileries for ye!  But gulp down your tears and hie aloft to the
375	royal-mast with your hearts; for your friends who have gone before
376	are clearing out the seven-storied heavens, and making refugees of
377	long-pampered Gabriel, Michael, and Raphael, against your coming.
378	Here ye strike but splintered hearts together--there, ye shall strike
379	unsplinterable glasses!

400	"Scarcely had we proceeded two days on the sea, when about sunrise a
great many Whales and other monsters of the sea, appeared.  Among the
former, one was of a most monstrous size. ...  This came towards us,
open-mouthed, raising the waves on all sides, and beating the sea
before him into a foam. --TOOKE'S LUCIAN.  THE TRUE HISTORY."

He said that he was one of six who had killed sixty in two days."

CHAPTER 1

Loomings.


Call me Ishmael.  Some years ago--never mind how long
precisely--having little or no money in my purse, and nothing
particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a
little and see the watery part of the world.  It is a way I have of
driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation.  Whenever I
find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp,
drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily
pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every
funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper
hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me
from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking
people's hats off--then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon
as I can.  This is my substitute for pistol and ball.  With a
philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly
take to the ship.  There is nothing surprising in this.  If they but
knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish
very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.

There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by
wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs--commerce surrounds it with
her surf.  Right and left, the streets take you waterward.  Its
extreme downtown is the battery, where that noble mole is washed by
waves, and cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of
sight of land.  Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.

Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon.  Go from
Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall,
northward.  What do you see?--Posted like silent sentinels all around
the town, stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean
reveries.  Some leaning against the spiles; some seated upon the
pier-heads; some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some
high aloft in the rigging, as if striving to get a still better
seaward peep.  But these are all landsmen; of week days pent up in
lath and plaster--tied to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to
desks.  How then is this?  Are the green fields gone?  What do they
here?

But look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and
seemingly bound for a dive.  Strange!  Nothing will content them but
the extremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of
yonder warehouses will not suffice.  No.  They must get just as nigh
the water as they possibly can without falling in.  And there they
stand--miles of them--leagues.  Inlanders all, they come from lanes
and alleys, streets and avenues--north, east, south, and west.  Yet
here they all unite.  Tell me, does the magnetic virtue of the
needles of the compasses of all those ships attract them thither?

Once more.  Say you are in the country; in some high land of lakes.
Take almost any path you please, and ten to one it carries you down
in a dale, and leaves you there by a pool in the stream.  There is
magic in it.  Let the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his
deepest reveries--stand that man on his legs, set his feet a-going,
and he will infallibly lead you to water, if water there be in all
that region.  Should you ever be athirst in the great American
desert, try this experiment, if your caravan happen to be supplied
with a metaphysical professor.  Yes, as every one knows, meditation
and water are wedded for ever.

But here is an artist.  He desires to paint you the dreamiest,
shadiest, quietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all
the valley of the Saco.  What is the chief element he employs?  There
stand his trees, each with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a
crucifix were within; and here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep his
cattle; and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke.  Deep into
distant woodlands winds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of
mountains bathed in their hill-side blue.  But though the picture
lies thus tranced, and though this pine-tree shakes down its sighs
like leaves upon this shepherd's head, yet all were vain, unless the
shepherd's eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him.  Go visit
the Prairies in June, when for scores on scores of miles you wade
knee-deep among Tiger-lilies--what is the one charm
wanting?--Water--there is not a drop of water there!  Were Niagara
but a cataract of sand, would you travel your thousand miles to see
it?  Why did the poor poet of Tennessee, upon suddenly receiving two
handfuls of silver, deliberate whether to buy him a coat, which he
sadly needed, or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to Rockaway
Beach?  Why is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy
soul in him, at some time or other crazy to go to sea?  Why upon your
first voyage as a passenger, did you yourself feel such a mystical
vibration, when first told that you and your ship were now out of
sight of land?  Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy?  Why did
the Greeks give it a separate deity, and own brother of Jove?  Surely
all this is not without meaning.  And still deeper the meaning of
that story of Narcissus, who because he could not grasp the
tormenting, mild image he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and
was drowned.  But that same image, we ourselves see in all rivers and
oceans.  It is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life; and this
is the key to it all.

Now, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I
begin to grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of
my lungs, I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as
a passenger.  For to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse,
and a purse is but a rag unless you have something in it.  Besides,
passengers get sea-sick--grow quarrelsome--don't sleep of nights--do
not enjoy themselves much, as a general thing;--no, I never go as a
passenger; nor, though I am something of a salt, do I ever go to sea
as a Commodore, or a Captain, or a Cook.  I abandon the glory and
distinction of such offices to those who like them.  For my part, I
abominate all honourable respectable toils, trials, and tribulations
of every kind whatsoever.  It is quite as much as I can do to take
care of myself, without taking care of ships, barques, brigs,
schooners, and what not.  And as for going as cook,--though I confess
there is considerable glory in that, a cook being a sort of officer
on ship-board--yet, somehow, I never fancied broiling fowls;--though
once broiled, judiciously buttered, and judgmatically salted and
peppered, there is no one who will speak more respectfully, not to
say reverentially, of a broiled fowl than I will.  It is out of the
idolatrous dotings of the old Egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted
river horse, that you see the mummies of those creatures in their
huge bake-houses the pyramids.

No, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the mast,
plumb down into the forecastle, aloft there to the royal mast-head.
True, they rather order me about some, and make me jump from spar to
spar, like a grasshopper in a May meadow.  And at first, this sort of
thing is unpleasant enough.  It touches one's sense of honour,
particularly if you come of an old established family in the land,
the Van Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes.  And more than
all, if just previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot, you have
been lording it as a country schoolmaster, making the tallest boys
stand in awe of you.  The transition is a keen one, I assure you,
from a schoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong decoction of
Seneca and the Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it.  But even
this wears off in time.

What of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a
broom and sweep down the decks?  What does that indignity amount to,
weighed, I mean, in the scales of the New Testament?  Do you think
the archangel Gabriel thinks anything the less of me, because I
promptly and respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular
instance?  Who ain't a slave?  Tell me that.  Well, then, however the
old sea-captains may order me about--however they may thump and punch
me about, I have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right;
that everybody else is one way or other served in much the same
way--either in a physical or metaphysical point of view, that is; and
so the universal thump is passed round, and all hands should rub each
other's shoulder-blades, and be content.

Again, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point of
paying me for my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers a single
penny that I ever heard of.  On the contrary, passengers themselves
must pay.  And there is all the difference in the world between
paying and being paid.  The act of paying is perhaps the most
uncomfortable infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon
us.  But BEING PAID,--what will compare with it?  The urbane activity
with which a man receives money is really marvellous, considering
that we so earnestly believe money to be the root of all earthly
ills, and that on no account can a monied man enter heaven.  Ah! how
cheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition!

Finally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesome
exercise and pure air of the fore-castle deck.  For as in this world,
head winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern (that is, if
you never violate the Pythagorean maxim), so for the most part the
Commodore on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from
the sailors on the forecastle.  He thinks he breathes it first; but
not so.  In much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in
many other things, at the same time that the leaders little suspect
it.  But wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea
as a merchant sailor, I should now take it into my head to go on a
whaling voyage; this the invisible police officer of the Fates, who
has the constant surveillance of me, and secretly dogs me, and
influences me in some unaccountable way--he can better answer than
any one else.  And, doubtless, my going on this whaling voyage,
formed part of the grand programme of Providence that was drawn up a
long time ago.  It came in as a sort of brief interlude and solo
between more extensive performances.  I take it that this part of the
bill must have run something like this:


GRAND CONTESTED ELECTION FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES."
611	"WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL.
BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN.


Though I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers,
the Fates, put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage, when
others were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies, and
short and easy parts in genteel comedies, and jolly parts in
farces--though I cannot tell why this was exactly; yet, now that I
recall all the circumstances, I think I can see a little into the
springs and motives which being cunningly presented to me under
various disguises, induced me to set about performing the part I did,
besides cajoling me into the delusion that it was a choice resulting
from my own unbiased freewill and discriminating judgment.

Chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great
whale himself.  Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all
my curiosity.  Then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his
island bulk; the undeliverable, nameless perils of the whale; these,
with all the attending marvels of a thousand Patagonian sights and
sounds, helped to sway me to my wish.  With other men, perhaps, such
things would not have been inducements; but as for me, I am tormented
with an everlasting itch for things remote.  I love to sail forbidden
seas, and land on barbarous coasts.  Not ignoring what is good, I am
quick to perceive a horror, and could still be social with it--would
they let me--since it is but well to be on friendly terms with all
the inmates of the place one lodges in.

By reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was welcome; the
great flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open, and in the wild
conceits that swayed me to my purpose, two and two there floated into
my inmost soul, endless processions of the whale, and, mid most of
them all, one grand hooded phantom, like a snow hill in the air.



CHAPTER 2

The Carpet-Bag.


I stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag, tucked it under my
arm, and started for Cape Horn and the Pacific.  Quitting the good
city of old Manhatto, I duly arrived in New Bedford.  It was a
Saturday night in December.  Much was I disappointed upon learning
that the little packet for Nantucket had already sailed, and that no
way of reaching that place would offer, till the following Monday.

As most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop
at this same New Bedford, thence to embark on their voyage, it may as
well be related that I, for one, had no idea of so doing.  For my
mind was made up to sail in no other than a Nantucket craft, because
there was a fine, boisterous something about everything connected
with that famous old island, which amazingly pleased me.  Besides
though New Bedford has of late been gradually monopolising the
business of whaling, and though in this matter poor old Nantucket is
now much behind her, yet Nantucket was her great original--the Tyre
of this Carthage;--the place where the first dead American whale was
stranded.  Where else but from Nantucket did those aboriginal
whalemen, the Red-Men, first sally out in canoes to give chase to the
Leviathan?  And where but from Nantucket, too, did that first
adventurous little sloop put forth, partly laden with imported
cobblestones--so goes the story--to throw at the whales, in order to
discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the
bowsprit?

Now having a night, a day, and still another night following before
me in New Bedford, ere I could embark for my destined port, it
became a matter of concernment where I was to eat and sleep
meanwhile.  It was a very dubious-looking, nay, a very dark and
dismal night, bitingly cold and cheerless.  I knew no one in the
place.  With anxious grapnels I had sounded my pocket, and only
brought up a few pieces of silver,--So, wherever you go, Ishmael,
said I to myself, as I stood in the middle of a dreary street
shouldering my bag, and comparing the gloom towards the north with
the darkness towards the south--wherever in your wisdom you may
conclude to lodge for the night, my dear Ishmael, be sure to inquire
the price, and don't be too particular.

With halting steps I paced the streets, and passed the sign of The"
612	"Crossed Harpoons--but it looked too expensive and jolly there.
Further on, from the bright red windows of the Sword-Fish Inn,
there came such fervent rays, that it seemed to have melted the
packed snow and ice from before the house, for everywhere else the
congealed frost lay ten inches thick in a hard, asphaltic
pavement,--rather weary for me, when I struck my foot against the
flinty projections, because from hard, remorseless service the soles
of my boots were in a most miserable plight.  Too expensive and
jolly, again thought I, pausing one moment to watch the broad glare
in the street, and hear the sounds of the tinkling glasses within.
But go on, Ishmael, said I at last; don't you hear? get away from
before the door; your patched boots are stopping the way.  So on I
went.  I now by instinct followed the streets that took me waterward,
for there, doubtless, were the cheapest, if not the cheeriest inns.

Such dreary streets! blocks of blackness, not houses, on either
hand, and here and there a candle, like a candle moving about in a
tomb.  At this hour of the night, of the last day of the week, that
quarter of the town proved all but deserted.  But presently I came to
a smoky light proceeding from a low, wide building, the door of which
stood invitingly open.  It had a careless look, as if it were meant
for the uses of the public; so, entering, the first thing I did was
to stumble over an ash-box in the porch.  Ha! thought I, ha, as the
flying particles almost choked me, are these ashes from that
destroyed city, Gomorrah?  But The Crossed Harpoons, and The"
613	"Sword-Fish?--this, then must needs be the sign of The Trap.
However, I picked myself up and hearing a loud voice within, pushed
on and opened a second, interior door.

It seemed the great Black Parliament sitting in Tophet.  A hundred
black faces turned round in their rows to peer; and beyond, a black
Angel of Doom was beating a book in a pulpit.  It was a negro church;
and the preacher's text was about the blackness of darkness, and the
weeping and wailing and teeth-gnashing there.  Ha, Ishmael, muttered
I, backing out, Wretched entertainment at the sign of 'The Trap!'

Moving on, I at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the
docks, and heard a forlorn creaking in the air; and looking up, saw a
swinging sign over the door with a white painting upon it, faintly
representing a tall straight jet of misty spray, and these words
underneath--The Spouter Inn:--Peter Coffin.

Coffin?--Spouter?--Rather ominous in that particular connexion,
thought I.  But it is a common name in Nantucket, they say, and I
suppose this Peter here is an emigrant from there.  As the light
looked so dim, and the place, for the time, looked quiet enough, and
the dilapidated little wooden house itself looked as if it might have
been carted here from the ruins of some burnt district, and as the
swinging sign had a poverty-stricken sort of creak to it, I thought
that here was the very spot for cheap lodgings, and the best of pea
coffee.

It was a queer sort of place--a gable-ended old house, one side
palsied as it were, and leaning over sadly.  It stood on a sharp
bleak corner, where that tempestuous wind Euroclydon kept up a worse
howling than ever it did about poor Paul's tossed craft.  Euroclydon,
nevertheless, is a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one in-doors, with
his feet on the hob quietly toasting for bed.  In judging of that"
614	"tempestuous wind called Euroclydon, says an old writer--of whose
works I possess the only copy extant--it maketh a marvellous"
615	difference, whether thou lookest out at it from a glass window where
616	the frost is all on the outside, or whether thou observest it from
617	that sashless window, where the frost is on both sides, and of which
618	"the wight Death is the only glazier.  True enough, thought I, as
this passage occurred to my mind--old black-letter, thou reasonest
well.  Yes, these eyes are windows, and this body of mine is the
house.  What a pity they didn't stop up the chinks and the crannies
though, and thrust in a little lint here and there.  But it's too
late to make any improvements now.  The universe is finished; the
copestone is on, and the chips were carted off a million years ago.
Poor Lazarus there, chattering his teeth against the curbstone for
his pillow, and shaking off his tatters with his shiverings, he might
plug up both ears with rags, and put a corn-cob into his mouth, and
yet that would not keep out the tempestuous Euroclydon.  Euroclydon!
says old Dives, in his red silken wrapper--(he had a redder one
afterwards) pooh, pooh!  What a fine frosty night; how Orion
glitters; what northern lights!  Let them talk of their oriental
summer climes of everlasting conservatories; give me the privilege of
making my own summer with my own coals.

But what thinks Lazarus?  Can he warm his blue hands by holding them
up to the grand northern lights?  Would not Lazarus rather be in
Sumatra than here?  Would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise
along the line of the equator; yea, ye gods! go down to the fiery pit
itself, in order to keep out this frost?

Now, that Lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before
the door of Dives, this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should
be moored to one of the Moluccas.  Yet Dives himself, he too lives
like a Czar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs, and being a
president of a temperance society, he only drinks the tepid tears of
orphans.

But no more of this blubbering now, we are going a-whaling, and there
is plenty of that yet to come.  Let us scrape the ice from our
frosted feet, and see what sort of a place this Spouter may be.



CHAPTER 3

The Spouter-Inn.


Entering that gable-ended Spouter-Inn, you found yourself in a wide,
low, straggling entry with old-fashioned wainscots, reminding one of
the bulwarks of some condemned old craft.  On one side hung a very
large oilpainting so thoroughly besmoked, and every way defaced,
that in the unequal crosslights by which you viewed it, it was only
by diligent study and a series of systematic visits to it, and
careful inquiry of the neighbors, that you could any way arrive at an
understanding of its purpose.  Such unaccountable masses of shades
and shadows, that at first you almost thought some ambitious young
artist, in the time of the New England hags, had endeavored to
delineate chaos bewitched.  But by dint of much and earnest
contemplation, and oft repeated ponderings, and especially by
throwing open the little window towards the back of the entry, you at
last come to the conclusion that such an idea, however wild, might
not be altogether unwarranted.

But what most puzzled and confounded you was a long, limber,
portentous, black mass of something hovering in the centre of the
picture over three blue, dim, perpendicular lines floating in a
nameless yeast.  A boggy, soggy, squitchy picture truly, enough to
drive a nervous man distracted.  Yet was there a sort of indefinite,
half-attained, unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze you
to it, till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself to find out
what that marvellous painting meant.  Ever and anon a bright, but,
alas, deceptive idea would dart you through.--It's the Black Sea in a
midnight gale.--It's the unnatural combat of the four primal
elements.--It's a blasted heath.--It's a Hyperborean winter
scene.--It's the breaking-up of the icebound stream of Time.  But at
last all these fancies yielded to that one portentous something in
the picture's midst.  THAT once found out, and all the rest were
plain.  But stop; does it not bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic
fish? even the great leviathan himself?

In fact, the artist's design seemed this: a final theory of my own,
partly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with
whom I conversed upon the subject.  The picture represents a
Cape-Horner in a great hurricane; the half-foundered ship weltering
there with its three dismantled masts alone visible; and an
exasperated whale, purposing to spring clean over the craft, is in
the enormous act of impaling himself upon the three mast-heads.

The opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish
array of monstrous clubs and spears.  Some were thickly set with
glittering teeth resembling ivory saws; others were tufted with knots
of human hair; and one was sickle-shaped, with a vast handle sweeping
round like the segment made in the new-mown grass by a long-armed
mower.  You shuddered as you gazed, and wondered what monstrous
cannibal and savage could ever have gone a death-harvesting with such
a hacking, horrifying implement.  Mixed with these were rusty old
whaling lances and harpoons all broken and deformed.  Some were
storied weapons.  With this once long lance, now wildly elbowed,
fifty years ago did Nathan Swain kill fifteen whales between a
sunrise and a sunset.  And that harpoon--so like a corkscrew now--was
flung in Javan seas, and run away with by a whale, years afterwards
slain off the Cape of Blanco.  The original iron entered nigh the
tail, and, like a restless needle sojourning in the body of a man,
travelled full forty feet, and at last was found imbedded in the
hump.

Crossing this dusky entry, and on through yon low-arched way--cut
through what in old times must have been a great central chimney with
fireplaces all round--you enter the public room.  A still duskier
place is this, with such low ponderous beams above, and such old
wrinkled planks beneath, that you would almost fancy you trod some
old craft's cockpits, especially of such a howling night, when this
corner-anchored old ark rocked so furiously.  On one side stood a
long, low, shelf-like table covered with cracked glass cases, filled
with dusty rarities gathered from this wide world's remotest nooks.
Projecting from the further angle of the room stands a dark-looking
den--the bar--a rude attempt at a right whale's head.  Be that how it
may, there stands the vast arched bone of the whale's jaw, so wide, a
coach might almost drive beneath it.  Within are shabby shelves,
ranged round with old decanters, bottles, flasks; and in those jaws
of swift destruction, like another cursed Jonah (by which name indeed
they called him), bustles a little withered old man, who, for their
money, dearly sells the sailors deliriums and death.

Abominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison.  Though
true cylinders without--within, the villanous green goggling glasses
deceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom.  Parallel
meridians rudely pecked into the glass, surround these footpads'
goblets.  Fill to THIS mark, and your charge is but a penny; to THIS
a penny more; and so on to the full glass--the Cape Horn measure,
which you may gulp down for a shilling.

Upon entering the place I found a number of young seamen gathered
about a table, examining by a dim light divers specimens of
SKRIMSHANDER.  I sought the landlord, and telling him I desired to be
accommodated with a room, received for answer that his house was
full--not a bed unoccupied.  But avast, he added, tapping his
forehead, you haint no objections to sharing a harpooneer's blanket,"
619	have ye?  I s'pose you are goin' a-whalin', so you'd better get used
620	"to that sort of thing.

I told him that I never liked to sleep two in a bed; that if I should
ever do so, it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be, and
that if he (the landlord) really had no other place for me, and the
harpooneer was not decidedly objectionable, why rather than wander
further about a strange town on so bitter a night, I would put up
with the half of any decent man's blanket.

I thought so.  All right; take a seat.  Supper?--you want supper?"
621	"Supper'll be ready directly.

I sat down on an old wooden settle, carved all over like a bench on
the Battery.  At one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning
it with his jack-knife, stooping over and diligently working away at
the space between his legs.  He was trying his hand at a ship under
full sail, but he didn't make much headway, I thought.

At last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an
adjoining room.  It was cold as Iceland--no fire at all--the landlord
said he couldn't afford it.  Nothing but two dismal tallow candles,
each in a winding sheet.  We were fain to button up our monkey
jackets, and hold to our lips cups of scalding tea with our half
frozen fingers.  But the fare was of the most substantial kind--not
only meat and potatoes, but dumplings; good heavens! dumplings for
supper!  One young fellow in a green box coat, addressed himself to
these dumplings in a most direful manner.

My boy, said the landlord, you'll have the nightmare to a dead"
622	"sartainty.

Landlord, I whispered, that aint the harpooneer is it?

Oh, no, said he, looking a sort of diabolically funny, the"
623	harpooneer is a dark complexioned chap.  He never eats dumplings, he
624	"don't--he eats nothing but steaks, and he likes 'em rare.

The devil he does, says I.  Where is that harpooneer?  Is he"
625	"here?

He'll be here afore long, was the answer.

I could not help it, but I began to feel suspicious of this dark"
626	"complexioned harpooneer.  At any rate, I made up my mind that if it
so turned out that we should sleep together, he must undress and get
into bed before I did.

Supper over, the company went back to the bar-room, when, knowing not
what else to do with myself, I resolved to spend the rest of the
evening as a looker on.

Presently a rioting noise was heard without.  Starting up, the
landlord cried, That's the Grampus's crew.  I seed her reported in"
627	the offing this morning; a three years' voyage, and a full ship.
628	"Hurrah, boys; now we'll have the latest news from the Feegees.

A tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry; the door was flung
open, and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough.  Enveloped in
their shaggy watch coats, and with their heads muffled in woollen
comforters, all bedarned and ragged, and their beards stiff with
icicles, they seemed an eruption of bears from Labrador.  They had
just landed from their boat, and this was the first house they
entered.  No wonder, then, that they made a straight wake for the
whale's mouth--the bar--when the wrinkled little old Jonah, there
officiating, soon poured them out brimmers all round.  One complained
of a bad cold in his head, upon which Jonah mixed him a pitch-like
potion of gin and molasses, which he swore was a sovereign cure for
all colds and catarrhs whatsoever, never mind of how long standing,
or whether caught off the coast of Labrador, or on the weather side
of an ice-island.

The liquor soon mounted into their heads, as it generally does even
with the arrantest topers newly landed from sea, and they began
capering about most obstreperously.

I observed, however, that one of them held somewhat aloof, and though
he seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his
own sober face, yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much
noise as the rest.  This man interested me at once; and since the
sea-gods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate (though
but a sleeping-partner one, so far as this narrative is concerned),
I will here venture upon a little description of him.  He stood full
six feet in height, with noble shoulders, and a chest like a
coffer-dam.  I have seldom seen such brawn in a man.  His face was
deeply brown and burnt, making his white teeth dazzling by the
contrast; while in the deep shadows of his eyes floated some
reminiscences that did not seem to give him much joy.  His voice at
once announced that he was a Southerner, and from his fine stature, I
thought he must be one of those tall mountaineers from the
Alleghanian Ridge in Virginia.  When the revelry of his companions
had mounted to its height, this man slipped away unobserved, and I
saw no more of him till he became my comrade on the sea.  In a few
minutes, however, he was missed by his shipmates, and being, it
seems, for some reason a huge favourite with them, they raised a cry
of Bulkington!  Bulkington! where's Bulkington? and darted out of
the house in pursuit of him.

It was now about nine o'clock, and the room seeming almost
supernaturally quiet after these orgies, I began to congratulate
myself upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to
the entrance of the seamen.

No man prefers to sleep two in a bed.  In fact, you would a good deal
rather not sleep with your own brother.  I don't know how it is, but
people like to be private when they are sleeping.  And when it comes
to sleeping with an unknown stranger, in a strange inn, in a strange
town, and that stranger a harpooneer, then your objections
indefinitely multiply.  Nor was there any earthly reason why I as a
sailor should sleep two in a bed, more than anybody else; for sailors
no more sleep two in a bed at sea, than bachelor Kings do ashore.  To
be sure they all sleep together in one apartment, but you have your
own hammock, and cover yourself with your own blanket, and sleep in
your own skin.

The more I pondered over this harpooneer, the more I abominated the
thought of sleeping with him.  It was fair to presume that being a
harpooneer, his linen or woollen, as the case might be, would not be
of the tidiest, certainly none of the finest.  I began to twitch all
over.  Besides, it was getting late, and my decent harpooneer ought
to be home and going bedwards.  Suppose now, he should tumble in upon
me at midnight--how could I tell from what vile hole he had been
coming?

Landlord!  I've changed my mind about that harpooneer.--I shan't"
629	"sleep with him.  I'll try the bench here.

Just as you please; I'm sorry I cant spare ye a tablecloth for a"
630	"mattress, and it's a plaguy rough board here--feeling of the knots
and notches.  But wait a bit, Skrimshander; I've got a carpenter's"
631	"plane there in the bar--wait, I say, and I'll make ye snug enough.
So saying he procured the plane; and with his old silk handkerchief
first dusting the bench, vigorously set to planing away at my bed,
the while grinning like an ape.  The shavings flew right and left;
till at last the plane-iron came bump against an indestructible knot.
The landlord was near spraining his wrist, and I told him for
heaven's sake to quit--the bed was soft enough to suit me, and I did
not know how all the planing in the world could make eider down of a
pine plank.  So gathering up the shavings with another grin, and
throwing them into the great stove in the middle of the room, he went
about his business, and left me in a brown study.

I now took the measure of the bench, and found that it was a foot too
short; but that could be mended with a chair.  But it was a foot too
narrow, and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher
than the planed one--so there was no yoking them.  I then placed the
first bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall,
leaving a little interval between, for my back to settle down in.
But I soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me
from under the sill of the window, that this plan would never do at
all, especially as another current from the rickety door met the one
from the window, and both together formed a series of small
whirlwinds in the immediate vicinity of the spot where I had thought
to spend the night.

The devil fetch that harpooneer, thought I, but stop, couldn't I
steal a march on him--bolt his door inside, and jump into his bed,
not to be wakened by the most violent knockings?  It seemed no bad
idea; but upon second thoughts I dismissed it.  For who could tell
but what the next morning, so soon as I popped out of the room, the
harpooneer might be standing in the entry, all ready to knock me
down!

Still, looking round me again, and seeing no possible chance of
spending a sufferable night unless in some other person's bed, I
began to think that after all I might be cherishing unwarrantable
prejudices against this unknown harpooneer.  Thinks I, I'll wait
awhile; he must be dropping in before long.  I'll have a good look at
him then, and perhaps we may become jolly good bedfellows after
all--there's no telling.

But though the other boarders kept coming in by ones, twos, and
threes, and going to bed, yet no sign of my harpooneer.

Landlord! said I, what sort of a chap is he--does he always keep
such late hours?  It was now hard upon twelve o'clock."
632	
633	The landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle, and seemed to be
634	mightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension.  No, he
635	"answered, generally he's an early bird--airley to bed and airley to
rise--yes, he's the bird what catches the worm.  But to-night he
went out a peddling, you see, and I don't see what on airth keeps him
so late, unless, may be, he can't sell his head."
636	
637	"Can't sell his head?--What sort of a bamboozingly story is this you
are telling me? getting into a towering rage.  Do you pretend to
say, landlord, that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed
Saturday night, or rather Sunday morning, in peddling his head around
this town?"
638	
639	"That's precisely it, said the landlord, and I told him he couldn't
sell it here, the market's overstocked."
640	
641	With what? shouted I.
642	
643	With heads to be sure; ain't there too many heads in the world?
644	
645	"I tell you what it is, landlord, said I quite calmly, you'd better
stop spinning that yarn to me--I'm not green."
646	
647	"May be not, taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick, but I
rayther guess you'll be done BROWN if that ere harpooneer hears you a
slanderin' his head."
648	
649	I'll break it for him, said I, now flying into a passion again at
650	this unaccountable farrago of the landlord's.
651	
652	It's broke a'ready, said he.
653	
654	Broke, said I--BROKE, do you mean?
655	
656	Sartain, and that's the very reason he can't sell it, I guess.
657	
658	Landlord, said I, going up to him as cool as Mt. Hecla in a
659	"snow-storm--landlord, stop whittling.  You and I must understand one
another, and that too without delay.  I come to your house and want a
bed; you tell me you can only give me half a one; that the other half
belongs to a certain harpooneer.  And about this harpooneer, whom I
have not yet seen, you persist in telling me the most mystifying and
exasperating stories tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling
towards the man whom you design for my bedfellow--a sort of
connexion, landlord, which is an intimate and confidential one in the
highest degree.  I now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and
what this harpooneer is, and whether I shall be in all respects safe
to spend the night with him.  And in the first place, you will be so
good as to unsay that story about selling his head, which if true I
take to be good evidence that this harpooneer is stark mad, and I've
no idea of sleeping with a madman; and you, sir, YOU I mean,
landlord, YOU, sir, by trying to induce me to do so knowingly, would
thereby render yourself liable to a criminal prosecution."
660	
661	"Wall, said the landlord, fetching a long breath, that's a purty
long sarmon for a chap that rips a little now and then.  But be easy,
be easy, this here harpooneer I have been tellin' you of has just
arrived from the south seas, where he bought up a lot of 'balmed New
Zealand heads (great curios, you know), and he's sold all on 'em but
one, and that one he's trying to sell to-night, cause to-morrow's
Sunday, and it would not do to be sellin' human heads about the
streets when folks is goin' to churches.  He wanted to, last Sunday,
but I stopped him just as he was goin' out of the door with four
heads strung on a string, for all the airth like a string of inions."
662	
663	This account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery, and
664	showed that the landlord, after all, had had no idea of fooling
665	me--but at the same time what could I think of a harpooneer who
666	stayed out of a Saturday night clean into the holy Sabbath, engaged
667	in such a cannibal business as selling the heads of dead idolators?
668	
669	Depend upon it, landlord, that harpooneer is a dangerous man.
670	
671	"He pays reg'lar, was the rejoinder.  But come, it's getting
dreadful late, you had better be turning flukes--it's a nice bed;
Sal and me slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced.  There's
plenty of room for two to kick about in that bed; it's an almighty
big bed that.  Why, afore we give it up, Sal used to put our Sam and
little Johnny in the foot of it.  But I got a dreaming and sprawling
about one night, and somehow, Sam got pitched on the floor, and came
near breaking his arm.  Arter that, Sal said it wouldn't do.  Come
along here, I'll give ye a glim in a jiffy; and so saying he lighted"
672	a candle and held it towards me, offering to lead the way.  But I
673	stood irresolute; when looking at a clock in the corner, he exclaimed
674	"I vum it's Sunday--you won't see that harpooneer to-night; he's come
to anchor somewhere--come along then; DO come; WON'T ye come?"
675	
676	I considered the matter a moment, and then up stairs we went, and I
677	was ushered into a small room, cold as a clam, and furnished, sure
678	enough, with a prodigious bed, almost big enough indeed for any four
679	harpooneers to sleep abreast.
680	
681	There, said the landlord, placing the candle on a crazy old sea
682	"chest that did double duty as a wash-stand and centre table; there,
make yourself comfortable now, and good night to ye.  I turned"
683	round from eyeing the bed, but he had disappeared.
684	
685	Folding back the counterpane, I stooped over the bed.  Though none of
686	the most elegant, it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well.  I then
687	glanced round the room; and besides the bedstead and centre table,
688	could see no other furniture belonging to the place, but a rude
689	shelf, the four walls, and a papered fireboard representing a man
690	striking a whale.  Of things not properly belonging to the room,
691	there was a hammock lashed up, and thrown upon the floor in one
692	corner; also a large seaman's bag, containing the harpooneer's
693	wardrobe, no doubt in lieu of a land trunk.  Likewise, there was a
694	parcel of outlandish bone fish hooks on the shelf over the
695	fire-place, and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed.
696	
697	But what is this on the chest?  I took it up, and held it close to
698	the light, and felt it, and smelt it, and tried every way possible to
699	arrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it.  I can compare
700	it to nothing but a large door mat, ornamented at the edges with
701	little tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills
702	round an Indian moccasin.  There was a hole or slit in the middle of
703	this mat, as you see the same in South American ponchos.  But could
704	it be possible that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat,
705	and parade the streets of any Christian town in that sort of guise?
706	I put it on, to try it, and it weighed me down like a hamper, being
707	uncommonly shaggy and thick, and I thought a little damp, as though
708	this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day.  I
709	went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall, and I never
710	saw such a sight in my life.  I tore myself out of it in such a hurry
711	that I gave myself a kink in the neck.
712	
713	I sat down on the side of the bed, and commenced thinking about this
714	head-peddling harpooneer, and his door mat.  After thinking some time
715	on the bed-side, I got up and took off my monkey jacket, and then
716	stood in the middle of the room thinking.  I then took off my coat,
717	and thought a little more in my shirt sleeves.  But beginning to feel
718	very cold now, half undressed as I was, and remembering what the
719	landlord said about the harpooneer's not coming home at all that
720	night, it being so very late, I made no more ado, but jumped out of
721	my pantaloons and boots, and then blowing out the light tumbled into
722	bed, and commended myself to the care of heaven.
723	
724	Whether that mattress was stuffed with corn-cobs or broken crockery,
725	there is no telling, but I rolled about a good deal, and could not
726	sleep for a long time.  At last I slid off into a light doze, and had
727	pretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of Nod, when I
728	heard a heavy footfall in the passage, and saw a glimmer of light
729	come into the room from under the door.
730	
731	Lord save me, thinks I, that must be the harpooneer, the infernal
732	head-peddler.  But I lay perfectly still, and resolved not to say a
733	word till spoken to.  Holding a light in one hand, and that identical
734	New Zealand head in the other, the stranger entered the room, and
735	without looking towards the bed, placed his candle a good way off
736	from me on the floor in one corner, and then began working away at
737	the knotted cords of the large bag I before spoke of as being in the
738	room.  I was all eagerness to see his face, but he kept it averted
739	for some time while employed in unlacing the bag's mouth.  This
740	accomplished, however, he turned round--when, good heavens! what a
741	sight!  Such a face!  It was of a dark, purplish, yellow colour, here
742	and there stuck over with large blackish looking squares.  Yes, it's
743	just as I thought, he's a terrible bedfellow; he's been in a fight,
744	got dreadfully cut, and here he is, just from the surgeon.  But at
745	that moment he chanced to turn his face so towards the light, that I
746	plainly saw they could not be sticking-plasters at all, those black
747	squares on his cheeks.  They were stains of some sort or other.  At
748	first I knew not what to make of this; but soon an inkling of the
749	truth occurred to me.  I remembered a story of a white man--a
750	whaleman too--who, falling among the cannibals, had been tattooed by
751	them.  I concluded that this harpooneer, in the course of his distant
752	voyages, must have met with a similar adventure.  And what is it,
753	thought I, after all!  It's only his outside; a man can be honest in
754	any sort of skin.  But then, what to make of his unearthly
755	complexion, that part of it, I mean, lying round about, and
756	completely independent of the squares of tattooing.  To be sure, it
757	might be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning; but I never
758	heard of a hot sun's tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one.
759	However, I had never been in the South Seas; and perhaps the sun
760	there produced these extraordinary effects upon the skin.  Now, while
761	all these ideas were passing through me like lightning, this
762	harpooneer never noticed me at all.  But, after some difficulty
763	having opened his bag, he commenced fumbling in it, and presently
764	pulled out a sort of tomahawk, and a seal-skin wallet with the hair
765	on.  Placing these on the old chest in the middle of the room, he
766	then took the New Zealand head--a ghastly thing enough--and crammed
767	it down into the bag.  He now took off his hat--a new beaver
768	hat--when I came nigh singing out with fresh surprise.  There was no
769	hair on his head--none to speak of at least--nothing but a small
770	scalp-knot twisted up on his forehead.  His bald purplish head now
771	looked for all the world like a mildewed skull.  Had not the stranger
772	stood between me and the door, I would have bolted out of it quicker
773	than ever I bolted a dinner.
774	
775	Even as it was, I thought something of slipping out of the window,
776	but it was the second floor back.  I am no coward, but what to make
777	of this head-peddling purple rascal altogether passed my
778	comprehension.  Ignorance is the parent of fear, and being completely
779	nonplussed and confounded about the stranger, I confess I was now as
780	much afraid of him as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken
781	into my room at the dead of night.  In fact, I was so afraid of him
782	that I was not game enough just then to address him, and demand a
783	satisfactory answer concerning what seemed inexplicable in him.
784	
785	Meanwhile, he continued the business of undressing, and at last
786	showed his chest and arms.  As I live, these covered parts of him
787	were checkered with the same squares as his face; his back, too, was
788	all over the same dark squares; he seemed to have been in a Thirty
789	Years' War, and just escaped from it with a sticking-plaster shirt.
790	Still more, his very legs were marked, as if a parcel of dark green
791	frogs were running up the trunks of young palms.  It was now quite
792	plain that he must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard
793	of a whaleman in the South Seas, and so landed in this Christian
794	country.  I quaked to think of it.  A peddler of heads too--perhaps
795	the heads of his own brothers.  He might take a fancy to
796	mine--heavens! look at that tomahawk!
797	
798	But there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage went about
799	something that completely fascinated my attention, and convinced me
800	that he must indeed be a heathen.  Going to his heavy grego, or
801	wrapall, or dreadnaught, which he had previously hung on a chair, he
802	fumbled in the pockets, and produced at length a curious little
803	deformed image with a hunch on its back, and exactly the colour of a
804	three days' old Congo baby.  Remembering the embalmed head, at first
805	I almost thought that this black manikin was a real baby preserved
806	in some similar manner.  But seeing that it was not at all limber,
807	and that it glistened a good deal like polished ebony, I concluded
808	that it must be nothing but a wooden idol, which indeed it proved to
809	be.  For now the savage goes up to the empty fire-place, and removing
810	the papered fire-board, sets up this little hunch-backed image, like
811	a tenpin, between the andirons.  The chimney jambs and all the bricks
812	inside were very sooty, so that I thought this fire-place made a very
813	appropriate little shrine or chapel for his Congo idol.
814	
815	I now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image, feeling but
816	ill at ease meantime--to see what was next to follow.  First he takes
817	about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket, and
818	places them carefully before the idol; then laying a bit of ship
819	biscuit on top and applying the flame from the lamp, he kindled the
820	shavings into a sacrificial blaze.  Presently, after many hasty
821	snatches into the fire, and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers
822	(whereby he seemed to be scorching them badly), he at last succeeded
823	in drawing out the biscuit; then blowing off the heat and ashes a
824	little, he made a polite offer of it to the little negro.  But the
825	little devil did not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at all; he
826	never moved his lips.  All these strange antics were accompanied by
827	still stranger guttural noises from the devotee, who seemed to be
828	praying in a sing-song or else singing some pagan psalmody or other,
829	during which his face twitched about in the most unnatural manner.
830	At last extinguishing the fire, he took the idol up very
831	unceremoniously, and bagged it again in his grego pocket as
832	carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock.
833	
834	All these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness, and
835	seeing him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business
836	operations, and jumping into bed with me, I thought it was high time,
837	now or never, before the light was put out, to break the spell in
838	which I had so long been bound.
839	
840	But the interval I spent in deliberating what to say, was a fatal
841	one.  Taking up his tomahawk from the table, he examined the head of
842	it for an instant, and then holding it to the light, with his mouth
843	at the handle, he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke.  The next
844	moment the light was extinguished, and this wild cannibal, tomahawk
845	between his teeth, sprang into bed with me.  I sang out, I could not
846	help it now; and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began
847	feeling me.
848	
849	Stammering out something, I knew not what, I rolled away from him
850	against the wall, and then conjured him, whoever or whatever he might
851	be, to keep quiet, and let me get up and light the lamp again.  But
852	his guttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill
853	comprehended my meaning.
854	
855	"Who-e debel you?--he at last said--you no speak-e, dam-me, I
kill-e.  And so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about"
856	me in the dark.
857	
858	"Landlord, for God's sake, Peter Coffin! shouted I.  Landlord!
Watch!  Coffin!  Angels! save me!"
859	
860	Speak-e! tell-ee me who-ee be, or dam-me, I kill-e! again growled
861	the cannibal, while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered
862	the hot tobacco ashes about me till I thought my linen would get on
863	fire.  But thank heaven, at that moment the landlord came into the
864	room light in hand, and leaping from the bed I ran up to him.
865	
866	"Don't be afraid now, said he, grinning again, Queequeg here
wouldn't harm a hair of your head."
867	
868	"Stop your grinning, shouted I, and why didn't you tell me that
that infernal harpooneer was a cannibal?"
869	
870	"I thought ye know'd it;--didn't I tell ye, he was a peddlin' heads
around town?--but turn flukes again and go to sleep.  Queequeg, look
here--you sabbee me, I sabbee--you this man sleepe you--you sabbee?"
871	
872	Me sabbee plenty--grunted Queequeg, puffing away at his pipe and
873	sitting up in bed.
874	
875	You gettee in, he added, motioning to me with his tomahawk, and
876	throwing the clothes to one side.  He really did this in not only a
877	civil but a really kind and charitable way.  I stood looking at him a
878	moment.  For all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean, comely
879	looking cannibal.  What's all this fuss I have been making about,
880	thought I to myself--the man's a human being just as I am: he has
881	just as much reason to fear me, as I have to be afraid of him.
882	Better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian.
883	
884	"Landlord, said I, tell him to stash his tomahawk there, or pipe,
or whatever you call it; tell him to stop smoking, in short, and I
will turn in with him.  But I don't fancy having a man smoking in bed
with me.  It's dangerous.  Besides, I ain't insured."
885	
886	This being told to Queequeg, he at once complied, and again politely
887	motioned me to get into bed--rolling over to one side as much as to
888	"say--I won't touch a leg of ye.

Good night, landlord, said I, you may go.

I turned in, and never slept better in my life.



CHAPTER 4

The Counterpane.


Upon waking next morning about daylight, I found Queequeg's arm
thrown over me in the most loving and affectionate manner.  You had
almost thought I had been his wife.  The counterpane was of
patchwork, full of odd little parti-coloured squares and triangles;
and this arm of his tattooed all over with an interminable Cretan
labyrinth of a figure, no two parts of which were of one precise
shade--owing I suppose to his keeping his arm at sea unmethodically
in sun and shade, his shirt sleeves irregularly rolled up at various
times--this same arm of his, I say, looked for all the world like a
strip of that same patchwork quilt.  Indeed, partly lying on it as
the arm did when I first awoke, I could hardly tell it from the
quilt, they so blended their hues together; and it was only by the
sense of weight and pressure that I could tell that Queequeg was
hugging me.

My sensations were strange.  Let me try to explain them.  When I was
a child, I well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell
me; whether it was a reality or a dream, I never could entirely
settle.  The circumstance was this.  I had been cutting up some caper
or other--I think it was trying to crawl up the chimney, as I had
seen a little sweep do a few days previous; and my stepmother who,
somehow or other, was all the time whipping me, or sending me to bed
supperless,--my mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and
packed me off to bed, though it was only two o'clock in the afternoon
of the 21st June, the longest day in the year in our hemisphere.  I
felt dreadfully.  But there was no help for it, so up stairs I went
to my little room in the third floor, undressed myself as slowly as
possible so as to kill time, and with a bitter sigh got between the
sheets.

I lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must
elapse before I could hope for a resurrection.  Sixteen hours in bed!
the small of my back ached to think of it.  And it was so light too;
the sun shining in at the window, and a great rattling of coaches in
the streets, and the sound of gay voices all over the house.  I felt
worse and worse--at last I got up, dressed, and softly going down in
my stockinged feet, sought out my stepmother, and suddenly threw
myself at her feet, beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a
good slippering for my misbehaviour; anything indeed but condemning
me to lie abed such an unendurable length of time.  But she was the
best and most conscientious of stepmothers, and back I had to go to
my room.  For several hours I lay there broad awake, feeling a great
deal worse than I have ever done since, even from the greatest
subsequent misfortunes.  At last I must have fallen into a troubled
nightmare of a doze; and slowly waking from it--half steeped in
dreams--I opened my eyes, and the before sun-lit room was now wrapped
in outer darkness.  Instantly I felt a shock running through all my
frame; nothing was to be seen, and nothing was to be heard; but a
supernatural hand seemed placed in mine.  My arm hung over the
counterpane, and the nameless, unimaginable, silent form or phantom,
to which the hand belonged, seemed closely seated by my bed-side.
For what seemed ages piled on ages, I lay there, frozen with the most
awful fears, not daring to drag away my hand; yet ever thinking that
if I could but stir it one single inch, the horrid spell would be
broken.  I knew not how this consciousness at last glided away from
me; but waking in the morning, I shudderingly remembered it all, and
for days and weeks and months afterwards I lost myself in confounding
attempts to explain the mystery.  Nay, to this very hour, I often
puzzle myself with it.

Now, take away the awful fear, and my sensations at feeling the
supernatural hand in mine were very similar, in their strangeness,
to those which I experienced on waking up and seeing Queequeg's pagan
arm thrown round me.  But at length all the past night's events
soberly recurred, one by one, in fixed reality, and then I lay only
alive to the comical predicament.  For though I tried to move his
arm--unlock his bridegroom clasp--yet, sleeping as he was, he still
hugged me tightly, as though naught but death should part us twain.
I now strove to rouse him--Queequeg!--but his only answer was a
snore.  I then rolled over, my neck feeling as if it were in a
horse-collar; and suddenly felt a slight scratch.  Throwing aside the
counterpane, there lay the tomahawk sleeping by the savage's side, as
if it were a hatchet-faced baby.  A pretty pickle, truly, thought I;
abed here in a strange house in the broad day, with a cannibal and a
tomahawk!  Queequeg!--in the name of goodness, Queequeg, wake!  At
length, by dint of much wriggling, and loud and incessant
expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his hugging a fellow male
in that matrimonial sort of style, I succeeded in extracting a grunt;
and presently, he drew back his arm, shook himself all over like a
Newfoundland dog just from the water, and sat up in bed, stiff as a
pike-staff, looking at me, and rubbing his eyes as if he did not
altogether remember how I came to be there, though a dim
consciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning
over him.  Meanwhile, I lay quietly eyeing him, having no serious
misgivings now, and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a
creature.  When, at last, his mind seemed made up touching the
character of his bedfellow, and he became, as it were, reconciled to
the fact; he jumped out upon the floor, and by certain signs and
sounds gave me to understand that, if it pleased me, he would dress
first and then leave me to dress afterwards, leaving the whole
apartment to myself.  Thinks I, Queequeg, under the circumstances,
this is a very civilized overture; but, the truth is, these savages
have an innate sense of delicacy, say what you will; it is marvellous
how essentially polite they are.  I pay this particular compliment to
Queequeg, because he treated me with so much civility and
consideration, while I was guilty of great rudeness; staring at him
from the bed, and watching all his toilette motions; for the time my
curiosity getting the better of my breeding.  Nevertheless, a man
like Queequeg you don't see every day, he and his ways were well
worth unusual regarding.

He commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat, a very tall
one, by the by, and then--still minus his trowsers--he hunted up his
boots.  What under the heavens he did it for, I cannot tell, but his
next movement was to crush himself--boots in hand, and hat on--under
the bed; when, from sundry violent gaspings and strainings, I
inferred he was hard at work booting himself; though by no law of
propriety that I ever heard of, is any man required to be private
when putting on his boots.  But Queequeg, do you see, was a creature
in the transition stage--neither caterpillar nor butterfly.  He was
just enough civilized to show off his outlandishness in the strangest
possible manners.  His education was not yet completed.  He was an
undergraduate.  If he had not been a small degree civilized, he very
probably would not have troubled himself with boots at all; but then,
if he had not been still a savage, he never would have dreamt of
getting under the bed to put them on.  At last, he emerged with his
hat very much dented and crushed down over his eyes, and began
creaking and limping about the room, as if, not being much accustomed
to boots, his pair of damp, wrinkled cowhide ones--probably not made
to order either--rather pinched and tormented him at the first go off
of a bitter cold morning.

Seeing, now, that there were no curtains to the window, and that the
street being very narrow, the house opposite commanded a plain view
into the room, and observing more and more the indecorous figure that
Queequeg made, staving about with little else but his hat and boots
on; I begged him as well as I could, to accelerate his toilet
somewhat, and particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as
possible.  He complied, and then proceeded to wash himself.  At that
time in the morning any Christian would have washed his face; but
Queequeg, to my amazement, contented himself with restricting his
ablutions to his chest, arms, and hands.  He then donned his
waistcoat, and taking up a piece of hard soap on the wash-stand
centre table, dipped it into water and commenced lathering his face.
I was watching to see where he kept his razor, when lo and behold, he
takes the harpoon from the bed corner, slips out the long wooden
stock, unsheathes the head, whets it a little on his boot, and
striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall, begins a vigorous
scraping, or rather harpooning of his cheeks.  Thinks I, Queequeg,
this is using Rogers's best cutlery with a vengeance.  Afterwards I
wondered the less at this operation when I came to know of what fine
steel the head of a harpoon is made, and how exceedingly sharp the
long straight edges are always kept.

The rest of his toilet was soon achieved, and he proudly marched out
of the room, wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket, and
sporting his harpoon like a marshal's baton.



CHAPTER 5

Breakfast.


I quickly followed suit, and descending into the bar-room accosted
the grinning landlord very pleasantly.  I cherished no malice towards
him, though he had been skylarking with me not a little in the matter
of my bedfellow.

However, a good laugh is a mighty good thing, and rather too scarce a
good thing; the more's the pity.  So, if any one man, in his own
proper person, afford stuff for a good joke to anybody, let him not
be backward, but let him cheerfully allow himself to spend and be
spent in that way.  And the man that has anything bountifully
laughable about him, be sure there is more in that man than you
perhaps think for.

The bar-room was now full of the boarders who had been dropping in
the night previous, and whom I had not as yet had a good look at.
They were nearly all whalemen; chief mates, and second mates, and
third mates, and sea carpenters, and sea coopers, and sea
blacksmiths, and harpooneers, and ship keepers; a brown and brawny
company, with bosky beards; an unshorn, shaggy set, all wearing
monkey jackets for morning gowns.

You could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore.
This young fellow's healthy cheek is like a sun-toasted pear in hue,
and would seem to smell almost as musky; he cannot have been three
days landed from his Indian voyage.  That man next him looks a few
shades lighter; you might say a touch of satin wood is in him.  In
the complexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn, but slightly
bleached withal; HE doubtless has tarried whole weeks ashore.  But
who could show a cheek like Queequeg? which, barred with various
tints, seemed like the Andes' western slope, to show forth in one
array, contrasting climates, zone by zone.

Grub, ho! now cried the landlord, flinging open a door, and in we
went to breakfast.

They say that men who have seen the world, thereby become quite at
ease in manner, quite self-possessed in company.  Not always, though:
Ledyard, the great New England traveller, and Mungo Park, the Scotch
one; of all men, they possessed the least assurance in the parlor.
But perhaps the mere crossing of Siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as
Ledyard did, or the taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach,
in the negro heart of Africa, which was the sum of poor Mungo's
performances--this kind of travel, I say, may not be the very best
mode of attaining a high social polish.  Still, for the most part,
that sort of thing is to be had anywhere.

These reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance that
after we were all seated at the table, and I was preparing to hear
some good stories about whaling; to my no small surprise, nearly
every man maintained a profound silence.  And not only that, but they
looked embarrassed.  Yes, here were a set of sea-dogs, many of whom
without the slightest bashfulness had boarded great whales on the
high seas--entire strangers to them--and duelled them dead without
winking; and yet, here they sat at a social breakfast table--all of
the same calling, all of kindred tastes--looking round as sheepishly
at each other as though they had never been out of sight of some
sheepfold among the Green Mountains.  A curious sight; these bashful
bears, these timid warrior whalemen!

But as for Queequeg--why, Queequeg sat there among them--at the head
of the table, too, it so chanced; as cool as an icicle.  To be sure I
cannot say much for his breeding.  His greatest admirer could not
have cordially justified his bringing his harpoon into breakfast with
him, and using it there without ceremony; reaching over the table
with it, to the imminent jeopardy of many heads, and grappling the
beefsteaks towards him.  But THAT was certainly very coolly done by
him, and every one knows that in most people's estimation, to do
anything coolly is to do it genteelly.

We will not speak of all Queequeg's peculiarities here; how he
eschewed coffee and hot rolls, and applied his undivided attention to
beefsteaks, done rare.  Enough, that when breakfast was over he
withdrew like the rest into the public room, lighted his
tomahawk-pipe, and was sitting there quietly digesting and smoking
with his inseparable hat on, when I sallied out for a stroll.



CHAPTER 6

The Street.


If I had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandish
an individual as Queequeg circulating among the polite society of a
civilized town, that astonishment soon departed upon taking my first
daylight stroll through the streets of New Bedford.

In thoroughfares nigh the docks, any considerable seaport will
frequently offer to view the queerest looking nondescripts from
foreign parts.  Even in Broadway and Chestnut streets, Mediterranean
mariners will sometimes jostle the affrighted ladies.  Regent Street
is not unknown to Lascars and Malays; and at Bombay, in the Apollo
Green, live Yankees have often scared the natives.  But New Bedford
beats all Water Street and Wapping.  In these last-mentioned haunts
you see only sailors; but in New Bedford, actual cannibals stand
chatting at street corners; savages outright; many of whom yet carry
on their bones unholy flesh.  It makes a stranger stare.

But, besides the Feegeeans, Tongatobooarrs, Erromanggoans,
Pannangians, and Brighggians, and, besides the wild specimens of the
whaling-craft which unheeded reel about the streets, you will see
other sights still more curious, certainly more comical.  There
weekly arrive in this town scores of green Vermonters and New
Hampshire men, all athirst for gain and glory in the fishery.  They
are mostly young, of stalwart frames; fellows who have felled
forests, and now seek to drop the axe and snatch the whale-lance.
Many are as green as the Green Mountains whence they came.  In some
things you would think them but a few hours old.  Look there! that
chap strutting round the corner.  He wears a beaver hat and
swallow-tailed coat, girdled with a sailor-belt and sheath-knife.
Here comes another with a sou'-wester and a bombazine cloak.

No town-bred dandy will compare with a country-bred one--I mean a
downright bumpkin dandy--a fellow that, in the dog-days, will mow his
two acres in buckskin gloves for fear of tanning his hands.  Now when
a country dandy like this takes it into his head to make a
distinguished reputation, and joins the great whale-fishery, you
should see the comical things he does upon reaching the seaport.  In
bespeaking his sea-outfit, he orders bell-buttons to his waistcoats;
straps to his canvas trowsers.  Ah, poor Hay-Seed! how bitterly will
burst those straps in the first howling gale, when thou art driven,
straps, buttons, and all, down the throat of the tempest.

But think not that this famous town has only harpooneers, cannibals,
and bumpkins to show her visitors.  Not at all.  Still New Bedford is
a queer place.  Had it not been for us whalemen, that tract of land
would this day perhaps have been in as howling condition as the coast
of Labrador.  As it is, parts of her back country are enough to
frighten one, they look so bony.  The town itself is perhaps the
dearest place to live in, in all New England.  It is a land of oil,
true enough: but not like Canaan; a land, also, of corn and wine.
The streets do not run with milk; nor in the spring-time do they pave
them with fresh eggs.  Yet, in spite of this, nowhere in all America
will you find more patrician-like houses; parks and gardens more
opulent, than in New Bedford.  Whence came they? how planted upon
this once scraggy scoria of a country?

Go and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoons round yonder lofty
mansion, and your question will be answered.  Yes; all these brave
houses and flowery gardens came from the Atlantic, Pacific, and
Indian oceans.  One and all, they were harpooned and dragged up
hither from the bottom of the sea.  Can Herr Alexander perform a feat
like that?

In New Bedford, fathers, they say, give whales for dowers to their
daughters, and portion off their nieces with a few porpoises a-piece.
You must go to New Bedford to see a brilliant wedding; for, they
say, they have reservoirs of oil in every house, and every night
recklessly burn their lengths in spermaceti candles.

In summer time, the town is sweet to see; full of fine maples--long
avenues of green and gold.  And in August, high in air, the beautiful
and bountiful horse-chestnuts, candelabra-wise, proffer the passer-by
their tapering upright cones of congregated blossoms.  So omnipotent
is art; which in many a district of New Bedford has superinduced
bright terraces of flowers upon the barren refuse rocks thrown aside
at creation's final day.

And the women of New Bedford, they bloom like their own red roses.
But roses only bloom in summer; whereas the fine carnation of their
cheeks is perennial as sunlight in the seventh heavens.  Elsewhere
match that bloom of theirs, ye cannot, save in Salem, where they tell
me the young girls breathe such musk, their sailor sweethearts smell
them miles off shore, as though they were drawing nigh the odorous
Moluccas instead of the Puritanic sands.



CHAPTER 7

The Chapel.


In this same New Bedford there stands a Whaleman's Chapel, and few
are the moody fishermen, shortly bound for the Indian Ocean or
Pacific, who fail to make a Sunday visit to the spot.  I am sure that
I did not.

Returning from my first morning stroll, I again sallied out upon this
special errand.  The sky had changed from clear, sunny cold, to
driving sleet and mist.  Wrapping myself in my shaggy jacket of the
cloth called bearskin, I fought my way against the stubborn storm.
Entering, I found a small scattered congregation of sailors, and
sailors' wives and widows.  A muffled silence reigned, only broken at
times by the shrieks of the storm.  Each silent worshipper seemed
purposely sitting apart from the other, as if each silent grief were
insular and incommunicable.  The chaplain had not yet arrived; and
there these silent islands of men and women sat steadfastly eyeing
several marble tablets, with black borders, masoned into the wall on
either side the pulpit.  Three of them ran something like the
following, but I do not pretend to quote:--

HIS WIDOW.

Shaking off the sleet from my ice-glazed hat and jacket, I seated
myself near the door, and turning sideways was surprised to see
Queequeg near me.  Affected by the solemnity of the scene, there was
a wondering gaze of incredulous curiosity in his countenance.  This
savage was the only person present who seemed to notice my entrance;
because he was the only one who could not read, and, therefore, was
not reading those frigid inscriptions on the wall.  Whether any of
the relatives of the seamen whose names appeared there were now among
the congregation, I knew not; but so many are the unrecorded
accidents in the fishery, and so plainly did several women present
wear the countenance if not the trappings of some unceasing grief,
that I feel sure that here before me were assembled those, in whose
unhealing hearts the sight of those bleak tablets sympathetically
caused the old wounds to bleed afresh.

Oh! ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass; who standing
among flowers can say--here, HERE lies my beloved; ye know not the
desolation that broods in bosoms like these.  What bitter blanks in
those black-bordered marbles which cover no ashes!  What despair in
those immovable inscriptions!  What deadly voids and unbidden
infidelities in the lines that seem to gnaw upon all Faith, and
refuse resurrections to the beings who have placelessly perished
without a grave.  As well might those tablets stand in the cave of
Elephanta as here.

In what census of living creatures, the dead of mankind are included;
why it is that a universal proverb says of them, that they tell no
tales, though containing more secrets than the Goodwin Sands; how it
is that to his name who yesterday departed for the other world, we
prefix so significant and infidel a word, and yet do not thus entitle
him, if he but embarks for the remotest Indies of this living earth;
why the Life Insurance Companies pay death-forfeitures upon
immortals; in what eternal, unstirring paralysis, and deadly,
hopeless trance, yet lies antique Adam who died sixty round centuries
ago; how it is that we still refuse to be comforted for those who we
nevertheless maintain are dwelling in unspeakable bliss; why all the
living so strive to hush all the dead; wherefore but the rumor of a
knocking in a tomb will terrify a whole city.  All these things are
not without their meanings.

But Faith, like a jackal, feeds among the tombs, and even from these
dead doubts she gathers her most vital hope.

It needs scarcely to be told, with what feelings, on the eve of a
Nantucket voyage, I regarded those marble tablets, and by the murky
light of that darkened, doleful day read the fate of the whalemen who
had gone before me.  Yes, Ishmael, the same fate may be thine.  But
somehow I grew merry again.  Delightful inducements to embark, fine
chance for promotion, it seems--aye, a stove boat will make me an
immortal by brevet.  Yes, there is death in this business of
whaling--a speechlessly quick chaotic bundling of a man into
Eternity.  But what then?  Methinks we have hugely mistaken this
matter of Life and Death.  Methinks that what they call my shadow
here on earth is my true substance.  Methinks that in looking at
things spiritual, we are too much like oysters observing the sun
through the water, and thinking that thick water the thinnest of air.
Methinks my body is but the lees of my better being.  In fact take
my body who will, take it I say, it is not me.  And therefore three
cheers for Nantucket; and come a stove boat and stove body when they
will, for stave my soul, Jove himself cannot.



CHAPTER 8

The Pulpit.


I had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable
robustness entered; immediately as the storm-pelted door flew back
upon admitting him, a quick regardful eyeing of him by all the
congregation, sufficiently attested that this fine old man was the
chaplain.  Yes, it was the famous Father Mapple, so called by the
whalemen, among whom he was a very great favourite.  He had been a
sailor and a harpooneer in his youth, but for many years past had
dedicated his life to the ministry.  At the time I now write of,
Father Mapple was in the hardy winter of a healthy old age; that sort
of old age which seems merging into a second flowering youth, for
among all the fissures of his wrinkles, there shone certain mild
gleams of a newly developing bloom--the spring verdure peeping forth
even beneath February's snow.  No one having previously heard his
history, could for the first time behold Father Mapple without the
utmost interest, because there were certain engrafted clerical
peculiarities about him, imputable to that adventurous maritime life
he had led.  When he entered I observed that he carried no umbrella,
and certainly had not come in his carriage, for his tarpaulin hat ran
down with melting sleet, and his great pilot cloth jacket seemed
almost to drag him to the floor with the weight of the water it had
absorbed.  However, hat and coat and overshoes were one by one
removed, and hung up in a little space in an adjacent corner; when,
arrayed in a decent suit, he quietly approached the pulpit.

Like most old fashioned pulpits, it was a very lofty one, and since a
regular stairs to such a height would, by its long angle with the
floor, seriously contract the already small area of the chapel, the
architect, it seemed, had acted upon the hint of Father Mapple, and
finished the pulpit without a stairs, substituting a perpendicular
side ladder, like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea.
The wife of a whaling captain had provided the chapel with a handsome
pair of red worsted man-ropes for this ladder, which, being itself
nicely headed, and stained with a mahogany colour, the whole
contrivance, considering what manner of chapel it was, seemed by no
means in bad taste.  Halting for an instant at the foot of the
ladder, and with both hands grasping the ornamental knobs of the
man-ropes, Father Mapple cast a look upwards, and then with a truly
sailor-like but still reverential dexterity, hand over hand, mounted
the steps as if ascending the main-top of his vessel.

The perpendicular parts of this side ladder, as is usually the case
with swinging ones, were of cloth-covered rope, only the rounds were
of wood, so that at every step there was a joint.  At my first
glimpse of the pulpit, it had not escaped me that however convenient
for a ship, these joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary.
For I was not prepared to see Father Mapple after gaining the height,
slowly turn round, and stooping over the pulpit, deliberately drag up
the ladder step by step, till the whole was deposited within, leaving
him impregnable in his little Quebec.

I pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this.
Father Mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and
sanctity, that I could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any
mere tricks of the stage.  No, thought I, there must be some sober
reason for this thing; furthermore, it must symbolize something
unseen.  Can it be, then, that by that act of physical isolation, he
signifies his spiritual withdrawal for the time, from all outward
worldly ties and connexions?  Yes, for replenished with the meat and
wine of the word, to the faithful man of God, this pulpit, I see, is
a self-containing stronghold--a lofty Ehrenbreitstein, with a
perennial well of water within the walls.

But the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place,
borrowed from the chaplain's former sea-farings.  Between the marble
cenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit, the wall which formed its
back was adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship
beating against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and
snowy breakers.  But high above the flying scud and dark-rolling
clouds, there floated a little isle of sunlight, from which beamed
forth an angel's face; and this bright face shed a distinct spot of
radiance upon the ship's tossed deck, something like that silver
plate now inserted into the Victory's plank where Nelson fell.  Ah,"
889	noble ship, the angel seemed to say, beat on, beat on, thou noble
890	ship, and bear a hardy helm; for lo! the sun is breaking through; the
891	"clouds are rolling off--serenest azure is at hand.

Nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same sea-taste that
had achieved the ladder and the picture.  Its panelled front was in
the likeness of a ship's bluff bows, and the Holy Bible rested on a
projecting piece of scroll work, fashioned after a ship's
fiddle-headed beak.

What could be more full of meaning?--for the pulpit is ever this
earth's foremost part; all the rest comes in its rear; the pulpit
leads the world.  From thence it is the storm of God's quick wrath is
first descried, and the bow must bear the earliest brunt.  From
thence it is the God of breezes fair or foul is first invoked for
favourable winds.  Yes, the world's a ship on its passage out, and not
a voyage complete; and the pulpit is its prow.



CHAPTER 9

The Sermon.


Father Mapple rose, and in a mild voice of unassuming authority
ordered the scattered people to condense.  Starboard gangway,"
892	there! side away to larboard--larboard gangway to starboard!
893	"Midships! midships!

There was a low rumbling of heavy sea-boots among the benches, and a
still slighter shuffling of women's shoes, and all was quiet again,
and every eye on the preacher.

He paused a little; then kneeling in the pulpit's bows, folded his
large brown hands across his chest, uplifted his closed eyes, and
offered a prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling and praying
at the bottom of the sea.

This ended, in prolonged solemn tones, like the continual tolling of
a bell in a ship that is foundering at sea in a fog--in such tones he
commenced reading the following hymn; but changing his manner towards
the concluding stanzas, burst forth with a pealing exultation and
joy--

The ribs and terrors in the whale,"
894	Arched over me a dismal gloom,
895	While all God's sun-lit waves rolled by,
896	And lift me deepening down to doom.
897	
898	"I saw the opening maw of hell,
With endless pains and sorrows there;
Which none but they that feel can tell--
Oh, I was plunging to despair.

In black distress, I called my God,"
899	When I could scarce believe him mine,
900	He bowed his ear to my complaints--
901	No more the whale did me confine.
902	
903	"With speed he flew to my relief,
As on a radiant dolphin borne;
Awful, yet bright, as lightning shone
The face of my Deliverer God.

My song for ever shall record"
904	That terrible, that joyful hour;
905	I give the glory to my God,
906	His all the mercy and the power.
907	
908	
909	Nearly all joined in singing this hymn, which swelled high above the
910	howling of the storm.  A brief pause ensued; the preacher slowly
911	turned over the leaves of the Bible, and at last, folding his hand
912	"down upon the proper page, said: Beloved shipmates, clinch the last
verse of the first chapter of Jonah--'And God had prepared a great
fish to swallow up Jonah.'"
913	
914	"Shipmates, this book, containing only four chapters--four yarns--is
one of the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the Scriptures.
Yet what depths of the soul does Jonah's deep sealine sound! what a
pregnant lesson to us is this prophet!  What a noble thing is that
canticle in the fish's belly!  How billow-like and boisterously
grand!  We feel the floods surging over us; we sound with him to the
kelpy bottom of the waters; sea-weed and all the slime of the sea is
about us!  But WHAT is this lesson that the book of Jonah teaches?
Shipmates, it is a two-stranded lesson; a lesson to us all as sinful
men, and a lesson to me as a pilot of the living God.  As sinful men,
it is a lesson to us all, because it is a story of the sin,
hard-heartedness, suddenly awakened fears, the swift punishment,
repentance, prayers, and finally the deliverance and joy of Jonah.
As with all sinners among men, the sin of this son of Amittai was in
his wilful disobedience of the command of God--never mind now what
that command was, or how conveyed--which he found a hard command.
But all the things that God would have us do are hard for us to
do--remember that--and hence, he oftener commands us than endeavors
to persuade.  And if we obey God, we must disobey ourselves; and it
is in this disobeying ourselves, wherein the hardness of obeying God
consists.

With this sin of disobedience in him, Jonah still further flouts at"
915	God, by seeking to flee from Him.  He thinks that a ship made by men
916	will carry him into countries where God does not reign, but only the
917	Captains of this earth.  He skulks about the wharves of Joppa, and
918	seeks a ship that's bound for Tarshish.  There lurks, perhaps, a
919	hitherto unheeded meaning here.  By all accounts Tarshish could have
920	been no other city than the modern Cadiz.  That's the opinion of
921	learned men.  And where is Cadiz, shipmates?  Cadiz is in Spain; as
922	far by water, from Joppa, as Jonah could possibly have sailed in
923	those ancient days, when the Atlantic was an almost unknown sea.
924	Because Joppa, the modern Jaffa, shipmates, is on the most easterly
925	coast of the Mediterranean, the Syrian; and Tarshish or Cadiz more
926	than two thousand miles to the westward from that, just outside the
927	Straits of Gibraltar.  See ye not then, shipmates, that Jonah sought
928	to flee world-wide from God?  Miserable man!  Oh! most contemptible
929	and worthy of all scorn; with slouched hat and guilty eye, skulking
930	from his God; prowling among the shipping like a vile burglar
931	hastening to cross the seas.  So disordered, self-condemning is his
932	look, that had there been policemen in those days, Jonah, on the mere
933	suspicion of something wrong, had been arrested ere he touched a
934	deck.  How plainly he's a fugitive! no baggage, not a hat-box,
935	valise, or carpet-bag,--no friends accompany him to the wharf with
936	their adieux.  At last, after much dodging search, he finds the
937	Tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo; and as he steps
938	on board to see its Captain in the cabin, all the sailors for the
939	moment desist from hoisting in the goods, to mark the stranger's evil
940	eye.  Jonah sees this; but in vain he tries to look all ease and
941	confidence; in vain essays his wretched smile.  Strong intuitions of
942	the man assure the mariners he can be no innocent.  In their gamesome
943	"but still serious way, one whispers to the other--Jack, he's robbed
a widow; or, Joe, do you mark him; he's a bigamist; or, Harry
lad, I guess he's the adulterer that broke jail in old Gomorrah, or
belike, one of the missing murderers from Sodom.  Another runs to"
944	read the bill that's stuck against the spile upon the wharf to which
945	the ship is moored, offering five hundred gold coins for the
946	apprehension of a parricide, and containing a description of his
947	person.  He reads, and looks from Jonah to the bill; while all his
948	sympathetic shipmates now crowd round Jonah, prepared to lay their
949	hands upon him.  Frighted Jonah trembles, and summoning all his
950	boldness to his face, only looks so much the more a coward.  He will
951	not confess himself suspected; but that itself is strong suspicion.
952	So he makes the best of it; and when the sailors find him not to be
953	the man that is advertised, they let him pass, and he descends into
954	the cabin.
955	
956	"'Who's there?' cries the Captain at his busy desk, hurriedly making
out his papers for the Customs--'Who's there?'  Oh! how that harmless
question mangles Jonah!  For the instant he almost turns to flee
again.  But he rallies.  'I seek a passage in this ship to Tarshish;
how soon sail ye, sir?'  Thus far the busy Captain had not looked up
to Jonah, though the man now stands before him; but no sooner does he
hear that hollow voice, than he darts a scrutinizing glance.  'We
sail with the next coming tide,' at last he slowly answered, still
intently eyeing him.  'No sooner, sir?'--'Soon enough for any honest
man that goes a passenger.'  Ha!  Jonah, that's another stab.  But he
swiftly calls away the Captain from that scent.  'I'll sail with
ye,'--he says,--'the passage money how much is that?--I'll pay now.'
For it is particularly written, shipmates, as if it were a thing not
to be overlooked in this history, 'that he paid the fare thereof' ere
the craft did sail.  And taken with the context, this is full of
meaning.

Now Jonah's Captain, shipmates, was one whose discernment detects"
957	crime in any, but whose cupidity exposes it only in the penniless.
958	In this world, shipmates, sin that pays its way can travel freely,
959	and without a passport; whereas Virtue, if a pauper, is stopped at
960	all frontiers.  So Jonah's Captain prepares to test the length of
961	Jonah's purse, ere he judge him openly.  He charges him thrice the
962	usual sum; and it's assented to.  Then the Captain knows that Jonah
963	is a fugitive; but at the same time resolves to help a flight that
964	paves its rear with gold.  Yet when Jonah fairly takes out his purse,
965	prudent suspicions still molest the Captain.  He rings every coin to
966	find a counterfeit.  Not a forger, any way, he mutters; and Jonah is
967	put down for his passage.  'Point out my state-room, Sir,' says Jonah
968	now, 'I'm travel-weary; I need sleep.'  'Thou lookest like it,' says
969	the Captain, 'there's thy room.'  Jonah enters, and would lock the
970	door, but the lock contains no key.  Hearing him foolishly fumbling
971	there, the Captain laughs lowly to himself, and mutters something
972	about the doors of convicts' cells being never allowed to be locked
973	within.  All dressed and dusty as he is, Jonah throws himself into
974	his berth, and finds the little state-room ceiling almost resting on
975	his forehead.  The air is close, and Jonah gasps.  Then, in that
976	contracted hole, sunk, too, beneath the ship's water-line, Jonah
977	feels the heralding presentiment of that stifling hour, when the
978	whale shall hold him in the smallest of his bowels' wards.
979	
980	"Screwed at its axis against the side, a swinging lamp slightly
oscillates in Jonah's room; and the ship, heeling over towards the
wharf with the weight of the last bales received, the lamp, flame and
all, though in slight motion, still maintains a permanent obliquity
with reference to the room; though, in truth, infallibly straight
itself, it but made obvious the false, lying levels among which it
hung.  The lamp alarms and frightens Jonah; as lying in his berth his
tormented eyes roll round the place, and this thus far successful
fugitive finds no refuge for his restless glance.  But that
contradiction in the lamp more and more appals him.  The floor, the
ceiling, and the side, are all awry.  'Oh! so my conscience hangs in
me!' he groans, 'straight upwards, so it burns; but the chambers of
my soul are all in crookedness!'

Like one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed, still"
981	reeling, but with conscience yet pricking him, as the plungings of
982	the Roman race-horse but so much the more strike his steel tags into
983	him; as one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns in
984	giddy anguish, praying God for annihilation until the fit be passed;
985	and at last amid the whirl of woe he feels, a deep stupor steals over
986	him, as over the man who bleeds to death, for conscience is the
987	wound, and there's naught to staunch it; so, after sore wrestlings in
988	his berth, Jonah's prodigy of ponderous misery drags him drowning
989	down to sleep.
990	
991	"And now the time of tide has come; the ship casts off her cables;
and from the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for Tarshish, all
careening, glides to sea.  That ship, my friends, was the first of
recorded smugglers! the contraband was Jonah.  But the sea rebels; he
will not bear the wicked burden.  A dreadful storm comes on, the
ship is like to break.  But now when the boatswain calls all hands to
lighten her; when boxes, bales, and jars are clattering overboard;
when the wind is shrieking, and the men are yelling, and every plank
thunders with trampling feet right over Jonah's head; in all this
raging tumult, Jonah sleeps his hideous sleep.  He sees no black sky
and raging sea, feels not the reeling timbers, and little hears he or
heeds he the far rush of the mighty whale, which even now with open
mouth is cleaving the seas after him.  Aye, shipmates, Jonah was gone
down into the sides of the ship--a berth in the cabin as I have taken
it, and was fast asleep.  But the frightened master comes to him, and
shrieks in his dead ear, 'What meanest thou, O, sleeper! arise!'
Startled from his lethargy by that direful cry, Jonah staggers to his
feet, and stumbling to the deck, grasps a shroud, to look out upon
the sea.  But at that moment he is sprung upon by a panther billow
leaping over the bulwarks.  Wave after wave thus leaps into the ship,
and finding no speedy vent runs roaring fore and aft, till the
mariners come nigh to drowning while yet afloat.  And ever, as the
white moon shows her affrighted face from the steep gullies in the
blackness overhead, aghast Jonah sees the rearing bowsprit pointing
high upward, but soon beat downward again towards the tormented deep.

Terrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul.  In all his"
992	cringing attitudes, the God-fugitive is now too plainly known.  The
993	sailors mark him; more and more certain grow their suspicions of him,
994	and at last, fully to test the truth, by referring the whole matter
995	to high Heaven, they fall to casting lots, to see for whose
996	cause this great tempest was upon them.  The lot is Jonah's; that
997	discovered, then how furiously they mob him with their questions.
998	'What is thine occupation?  Whence comest thou?  Thy country?  What
999	people?  But mark now, my shipmates, the behavior of poor Jonah.  The
1000	eager mariners but ask him who he is, and where from; whereas, they
1001	not only receive an answer to those questions, but likewise another
1002	answer to a question not put by them, but the unsolicited answer is
1003	forced from Jonah by the hard hand of God that is upon him.
1004	
1005	"'I am a Hebrew,' he cries--and then--'I fear the Lord the God of
Heaven who hath made the sea and the dry land!'  Fear him, O Jonah?
Aye, well mightest thou fear the Lord God THEN!  Straightway, he now
goes on to make a full confession; whereupon the mariners became more
and more appalled, but still are pitiful.  For when Jonah, not yet
supplicating God for mercy, since he but too well knew the darkness
of his deserts,--when wretched Jonah cries out to them to take him
and cast him forth into the sea, for he knew that for HIS sake this
great tempest was upon them; they mercifully turn from him, and seek
by other means to save the ship.  But all in vain; the indignant gale
howls louder; then, with one hand raised invokingly to God, with the
other they not unreluctantly lay hold of Jonah.

And now behold Jonah taken up as an anchor and dropped into the sea;"
1006	when instantly an oily calmness floats out from the east, and the sea
1007	is still, as Jonah carries down the gale with him, leaving smooth
1008	water behind.  He goes down in the whirling heart of such a
1009	masterless commotion that he scarce heeds the moment when he drops
1010	seething into the yawning jaws awaiting him; and the whale shoots-to
1011	all his ivory teeth, like so many white bolts, upon his prison.  Then
1012	Jonah prayed unto the Lord out of the fish's belly.  But observe his
1013	prayer, and learn a weighty lesson.  For sinful as he is, Jonah does
1014	not weep and wail for direct deliverance.  He feels that his dreadful
1015	punishment is just.  He leaves all his deliverance to God, contenting
1016	himself with this, that spite of all his pains and pangs, he will
1017	still look towards His holy temple.  And here, shipmates, is true and
1018	faithful repentance; not clamorous for pardon, but grateful for
1019	punishment.  And how pleasing to God was this conduct in Jonah, is
1020	shown in the eventual deliverance of him from the sea and the whale.
1021	Shipmates, I do not place Jonah before you to be copied for his sin
1022	but I do place him before you as a model for repentance.  Sin not;
1023	"but if you do, take heed to repent of it like Jonah.

While he was speaking these words, the howling of the shrieking,
slanting storm without seemed to add new power to the preacher, who,
when describing Jonah's sea-storm, seemed tossed by a storm himself.
His deep chest heaved as with a ground-swell; his tossed arms seemed
the warring elements at work; and the thunders that rolled away from
off his swarthy brow, and the light leaping from his eye, made all
his simple hearers look on him with a quick fear that was strange to
them.

There now came a lull in his look, as he silently turned over the
leaves of the Book once more; and, at last, standing motionless, with
closed eyes, for the moment, seemed communing with God and himself.

But again he leaned over towards the people, and bowing his head
lowly, with an aspect of the deepest yet manliest humility, he spake
these words:

Shipmates, God has laid but one hand upon you; both his hands press"
1024	upon me.  I have read ye by what murky light may be mine the lesson
1025	that Jonah teaches to all sinners; and therefore to ye, and still
1026	more to me, for I am a greater sinner than ye.  And now how gladly
1027	would I come down from this mast-head and sit on the hatches there
1028	where you sit, and listen as you listen, while some one of you reads
1029	ME that other and more awful lesson which Jonah teaches to ME, as a
1030	pilot of the living God.  How being an anointed pilot-prophet, or
1031	speaker of true things, and bidden by the Lord to sound those
1032	unwelcome truths in the ears of a wicked Nineveh, Jonah, appalled at
1033	the hostility he should raise, fled from his mission, and sought to
1034	escape his duty and his God by taking ship at Joppa.  But God is
1035	everywhere; Tarshish he never reached.  As we have seen, God came
1036	upon him in the whale, and swallowed him down to living gulfs of
1037	doom, and with swift slantings tore him along 'into the midst of the
1038	seas,' where the eddying depths sucked him ten thousand fathoms down,
1039	and 'the weeds were wrapped about his head,' and all the watery world
1040	of woe bowled over him.  Yet even then beyond the reach of any
1041	plummet--'out of the belly of hell'--when the whale grounded upon the
1042	ocean's utmost bones, even then, God heard the engulphed, repenting
1043	prophet when he cried.  Then God spake unto the fish; and from the
1044	shuddering cold and blackness of the sea, the whale came breeching up
1045	towards the warm and pleasant sun, and all the delights of air and
1046	earth; and 'vomited out Jonah upon the dry land;' when the word of
1047	the Lord came a second time; and Jonah, bruised and beaten--his ears,
1048	like two sea-shells, still multitudinously murmuring of the
1049	ocean--Jonah did the Almighty's bidding.  And what was that,
1050	shipmates?  To preach the Truth to the face of Falsehood!  That was
1051	it!
1052	
1053	"This, shipmates, this is that other lesson; and woe to that pilot of
the living God who slights it.  Woe to him whom this world charms
from Gospel duty!  Woe to him who seeks to pour oil upon the waters
when God has brewed them into a gale!  Woe to him who seeks to please
rather than to appal!  Woe to him whose good name is more to him than
goodness!  Woe to him who, in this world, courts not dishonour!  Woe
to him who would not be true, even though to be false were salvation!
Yea, woe to him who, as the great Pilot Paul has it, while preaching
to others is himself a castaway!"
1054	
1055	He dropped and fell away from himself for a moment; then lifting his
1056	face to them again, showed a deep joy in his eyes, as he cried out
1057	"with a heavenly enthusiasm,--But oh! shipmates! on the starboard
hand of every woe, there is a sure delight; and higher the top of
that delight, than the bottom of the woe is deep.  Is not the
main-truck higher than the kelson is low?  Delight is to him--a far,
far upward, and inward delight--who against the proud gods and
commodores of this earth, ever stands forth his own inexorable self.
Delight is to him whose strong arms yet support him, when the ship of
this base treacherous world has gone down beneath him.  Delight is to
him, who gives no quarter in the truth, and kills, burns, and
destroys all sin though he pluck it out from under the robes of
Senators and Judges.  Delight,--top-gallant delight is to him, who
acknowledges no law or lord, but the Lord his God, and is only a
patriot to heaven.  Delight is to him, whom all the waves of the
billows of the seas of the boisterous mob can never shake from this
sure Keel of the Ages.  And eternal delight and deliciousness will be
his, who coming to lay him down, can say with his final breath--O
Father!--chiefly known to me by Thy rod--mortal or immortal, here I
die.  I have striven to be Thine, more than to be this world's, or
mine own.  Yet this is nothing: I leave eternity to Thee; for what
is man that he should live out the lifetime of his God?"
1058	
1059	He said no more, but slowly waving a benediction, covered his face
1060	with his hands, and so remained kneeling, till all the people had
1061	departed, and he was left alone in the place.
1062	
1063	
1064	
1065	CHAPTER 10
1066	
1067	A Bosom Friend.
1068	
1069	
1070	Returning to the Spouter-Inn from the Chapel, I found Queequeg there
1071	quite alone; he having left the Chapel before the benediction some
1072	time.  He was sitting on a bench before the fire, with his feet on
1073	the stove hearth, and in one hand was holding close up to his face
1074	that little negro idol of his; peering hard into its face, and with a
1075	jack-knife gently whittling away at its nose, meanwhile humming to
1076	himself in his heathenish way.
1077	
1078	But being now interrupted, he put up the image; and pretty soon,
1079	going to the table, took up a large book there, and placing it on his
1080	lap began counting the pages with deliberate regularity; at every
1081	fiftieth page--as I fancied--stopping a moment, looking vacantly
1082	around him, and giving utterance to a long-drawn gurgling whistle of
1083	astonishment.  He would then begin again at the next fifty; seeming
1084	to commence at number one each time, as though he could not count
1085	more than fifty, and it was only by such a large number of fifties
1086	being found together, that his astonishment at the multitude of pages
1087	was excited.
1088	
1089	With much interest I sat watching him.  Savage though he was, and
1090	hideously marred about the face--at least to my taste--his
1091	countenance yet had a something in it which was by no means
1092	disagreeable.  You cannot hide the soul.  Through all his unearthly
1093	tattooings, I thought I saw the traces of a simple honest heart; and
1094	in his large, deep eyes, fiery black and bold, there seemed tokens of
1095	a spirit that would dare a thousand devils.  And besides all this,
1096	there was a certain lofty bearing about the Pagan, which even his
1097	uncouthness could not altogether maim.  He looked like a man who had
1098	never cringed and never had had a creditor.  Whether it was, too,
1099	that his head being shaved, his forehead was drawn out in freer and
1100	brighter relief, and looked more expansive than it otherwise would,
1101	this I will not venture to decide; but certain it was his head was
1102	phrenologically an excellent one.  It may seem ridiculous, but it
1103	reminded me of General Washington's head, as seen in the popular
1104	busts of him.  It had the same long regularly graded retreating slope
1105	from above the brows, which were likewise very projecting, like two
1106	long promontories thickly wooded on top.  Queequeg was George
1107	Washington cannibalistically developed.
1108	
1109	Whilst I was thus closely scanning him, half-pretending meanwhile to
1110	be looking out at the storm from the casement, he never heeded my
1111	presence, never troubled himself with so much as a single glance; but
1112	appeared wholly occupied with counting the pages of the marvellous
1113	book.  Considering how sociably we had been sleeping together the
1114	night previous, and especially considering the affectionate arm I had
1115	found thrown over me upon waking in the morning, I thought this
1116	indifference of his very strange.  But savages are strange beings; at
1117	times you do not know exactly how to take them.  At first they are
1118	overawing; their calm self-collectedness of simplicity seems a
1119	Socratic wisdom.  I had noticed also that Queequeg never consorted at
1120	all, or but very little, with the other seamen in the inn.  He made
1121	no advances whatever; appeared to have no desire to enlarge the
1122	circle of his acquaintances.  All this struck me as mighty singular;
1123	yet, upon second thoughts, there was something almost sublime in it.
1124	Here was a man some twenty thousand miles from home, by the way of
1125	Cape Horn, that is--which was the only way he could get there--thrown
1126	among people as strange to him as though he were in the planet
1127	Jupiter; and yet he seemed entirely at his ease; preserving the
1128	utmost serenity; content with his own companionship; always equal to
1129	himself.  Surely this was a touch of fine philosophy; though no doubt
1130	he had never heard there was such a thing as that.  But, perhaps, to
1131	be true philosophers, we mortals should not be conscious of so living
1132	or so striving.  So soon as I hear that such or such a man gives
1133	himself out for a philosopher, I conclude that, like the dyspeptic
1134	old woman, he must have broken his digester.
1135	
1136	As I sat there in that now lonely room; the fire burning low, in that
1137	mild stage when, after its first intensity has warmed the air, it
1138	then only glows to be looked at; the evening shades and phantoms
1139	gathering round the casements, and peering in upon us silent,
1140	solitary twain; the storm booming without in solemn swells; I began
1141	to be sensible of strange feelings.  I felt a melting in me.  No more
1142	my splintered heart and maddened hand were turned against the wolfish
1143	world.  This soothing savage had redeemed it.  There he sat, his very
1144	indifference speaking a nature in which there lurked no civilized
1145	hypocrisies and bland deceits.  Wild he was; a very sight of sights
1146	to see; yet I began to feel myself mysteriously drawn towards him.
1147	And those same things that would have repelled most others, they were
1148	the very magnets that thus drew me.  I'll try a pagan friend, thought
1149	I, since Christian kindness has proved but hollow courtesy.  I drew
1150	my bench near him, and made some friendly signs and hints, doing my
1151	best to talk with him meanwhile.  At first he little noticed these
1152	advances; but presently, upon my referring to his last night's
1153	hospitalities, he made out to ask me whether we were again to be
1154	bedfellows.  I told him yes; whereat I thought he looked pleased,
1155	perhaps a little complimented.
1156	
1157	We then turned over the book together, and I endeavored to explain to
1158	him the purpose of the printing, and the meaning of the few pictures
1159	that were in it.  Thus I soon engaged his interest; and from that we
1160	went to jabbering the best we could about the various outer sights to
1161	be seen in this famous town.  Soon I proposed a social smoke; and,
1162	producing his pouch and tomahawk, he quietly offered me a puff.  And
1163	then we sat exchanging puffs from that wild pipe of his, and keeping
1164	it regularly passing between us.
1165	
1166	If there yet lurked any ice of indifference towards me in the Pagan's
1167	breast, this pleasant, genial smoke we had, soon thawed it out, and
1168	left us cronies.  He seemed to take to me quite as naturally and
1169	unbiddenly as I to him; and when our smoke was over, he pressed his
1170	forehead against mine, clasped me round the waist, and said that
1171	henceforth we were married; meaning, in his country's phrase, that we
1172	were bosom friends; he would gladly die for me, if need should be.
1173	In a countryman, this sudden flame of friendship would have seemed
1174	far too premature, a thing to be much distrusted; but in this simple
1175	savage those old rules would not apply.
1176	
1177	After supper, and another social chat and smoke, we went to our room
1178	together.  He made me a present of his embalmed head; took out his
1179	enormous tobacco wallet, and groping under the tobacco, drew out some
1180	thirty dollars in silver; then spreading them on the table, and
1181	mechanically dividing them into two equal portions, pushed one of
1182	them towards me, and said it was mine.  I was going to remonstrate;
1183	but he silenced me by pouring them into my trowsers' pockets.  I let
1184	them stay.  He then went about his evening prayers, took out his
1185	idol, and removed the paper fireboard.  By certain signs and
1186	symptoms, I thought he seemed anxious for me to join him; but well
1187	knowing what was to follow, I deliberated a moment whether, in case
1188	he invited me, I would comply or otherwise.
1189	
1190	I was a good Christian; born and bred in the bosom of the infallible
1191	Presbyterian Church.  How then could I unite with this wild idolator
1192	in worshipping his piece of wood?  But what is worship? thought I.
1193	Do you suppose now, Ishmael, that the magnanimous God of heaven and
1194	earth--pagans and all included--can possibly be jealous of an
1195	insignificant bit of black wood?  Impossible!  But what is
1196	worship?--to do the will of God--THAT is worship.  And what is the
1197	will of God?--to do to my fellow man what I would have my fellow man
1198	to do to me--THAT is the will of God.  Now, Queequeg is my fellow
1199	man.  And what do I wish that this Queequeg would do to me?  Why,
1200	unite with me in my particular Presbyterian form of worship.
1201	Consequently, I must then unite with him in his; ergo, I must turn
1202	idolator.  So I kindled the shavings; helped prop up the innocent
1203	little idol; offered him burnt biscuit with Queequeg; salamed before
1204	him twice or thrice; kissed his nose; and that done, we undressed and
1205	went to bed, at peace with our own consciences and all the world.
1206	But we did not go to sleep without some little chat.
1207	
1208	How it is I know not; but there is no place like a bed for
1209	confidential disclosures between friends.  Man and wife, they say,
1210	there open the very bottom of their souls to each other; and some old
1211	couples often lie and chat over old times till nearly morning.  Thus,
1212	then, in our hearts' honeymoon, lay I and Queequeg--a cosy, loving
1213	pair.
1214	
1215	
1216	
1217	CHAPTER 11
1218	
1219	Nightgown.
1220	
1221	
1222	We had lain thus in bed, chatting and napping at short intervals, and
1223	Queequeg now and then affectionately throwing his brown tattooed legs
1224	over mine, and then drawing them back; so entirely sociable and free
1225	and easy were we; when, at last, by reason of our confabulations,
1226	what little nappishness remained in us altogether departed, and we
1227	felt like getting up again, though day-break was yet some way down
1228	the future.
1229	
1230	Yes, we became very wakeful; so much so that our recumbent position
1231	began to grow wearisome, and by little and little we found ourselves
1232	sitting up; the clothes well tucked around us, leaning against the
1233	head-board with our four knees drawn up close together, and our two
1234	noses bending over them, as if our kneepans were warming-pans.  We
1235	felt very nice and snug, the more so since it was so chilly out of
1236	doors; indeed out of bed-clothes too, seeing that there was no fire
1237	in the room.  The more so, I say, because truly to enjoy bodily
1238	warmth, some small part of you must be cold, for there is no quality
1239	in this world that is not what it is merely by contrast.  Nothing
1240	exists in itself.  If you flatter yourself that you are all over
1241	comfortable, and have been so a long time, then you cannot be said to
1242	be comfortable any more.  But if, like Queequeg and me in the bed,
1243	the tip of your nose or the crown of your head be slightly chilled,
1244	why then, indeed, in the general consciousness you feel most
1245	delightfully and unmistakably warm.  For this reason a sleeping
1246	apartment should never be furnished with a fire, which is one of the
1247	luxurious discomforts of the rich.  For the height of this sort of
1248	deliciousness is to have nothing but the blanket between you and
1249	your snugness and the cold of the outer air.  Then there you lie like
1250	the one warm spark in the heart of an arctic crystal.
1251	
1252	We had been sitting in this crouching manner for some time, when all
1253	at once I thought I would open my eyes; for when between sheets,
1254	whether by day or by night, and whether asleep or awake, I have a way
1255	of always keeping my eyes shut, in order the more to concentrate the
1256	snugness of being in bed.  Because no man can ever feel his own
1257	identity aright except his eyes be closed; as if darkness were
1258	indeed the proper element of our essences, though light be more
1259	congenial to our clayey part.  Upon opening my eyes then, and coming
1260	out of my own pleasant and self-created darkness into the imposed and
1261	coarse outer gloom of the unilluminated twelve-o'clock-at-night, I
1262	experienced a disagreeable revulsion.  Nor did I at all object to the
1263	hint from Queequeg that perhaps it were best to strike a light,
1264	seeing that we were so wide awake; and besides he felt a strong
1265	desire to have a few quiet puffs from his Tomahawk.  Be it said, that
1266	though I had felt such a strong repugnance to his smoking in the bed
1267	the night before, yet see how elastic our stiff prejudices grow when
1268	love once comes to bend them.  For now I liked nothing better than
1269	to have Queequeg smoking by me, even in bed, because he seemed to be
1270	full of such serene household joy then.  I no more felt unduly
1271	concerned for the landlord's policy of insurance.  I was only alive
1272	to the condensed confidential comfortableness of sharing a pipe and a
1273	blanket with a real friend.  With our shaggy jackets drawn about our
1274	shoulders, we now passed the Tomahawk from one to the other, till
1275	slowly there grew over us a blue hanging tester of smoke, illuminated
1276	by the flame of the new-lit lamp.
1277	
1278	Whether it was that this undulating tester rolled the savage away to
1279	far distant scenes, I know not, but he now spoke of his native
1280	island; and, eager to hear his history, I begged him to go on and
1281	tell it.  He gladly complied.  Though at the time I but ill
1282	comprehended not a few of his words, yet subsequent disclosures, when
1283	I had become more familiar with his broken phraseology, now enable me
1284	to present the whole story such as it may prove in the mere skeleton
1285	I give.
1286	
1287	
1288	
1289	CHAPTER 12
1290	
1291	Biographical.
1292	
1293	
1294	Queequeg was a native of Rokovoko, an island far away to the West
1295	and South.  It is not down in any map; true places never are.
1296	
1297	When a new-hatched savage running wild about his native woodlands in
1298	a grass clout, followed by the nibbling goats, as if he were a green
1299	sapling; even then, in Queequeg's ambitious soul, lurked a strong
1300	desire to see something more of Christendom than a specimen whaler or
1301	two.  His father was a High Chief, a King; his uncle a High Priest;
1302	and on the maternal side he boasted aunts who were the wives of
1303	unconquerable warriors.  There was excellent blood in his
1304	veins--royal stuff; though sadly vitiated, I fear, by the cannibal
1305	propensity he nourished in his untutored youth.
1306	
1307	A Sag Harbor ship visited his father's bay, and Queequeg sought a
1308	passage to Christian lands.  But the ship, having her full complement
1309	of seamen, spurned his suit; and not all the King his father's
1310	influence could prevail.  But Queequeg vowed a vow.  Alone in his
1311	canoe, he paddled off to a distant strait, which he knew the ship
1312	must pass through when she quitted the island.  On one side was a
1313	coral reef; on the other a low tongue of land, covered with mangrove
1314	thickets that grew out into the water.  Hiding his canoe, still
1315	afloat, among these thickets, with its prow seaward, he sat down in
1316	the stern, paddle low in hand; and when the ship was gliding by, like
1317	a flash he darted out; gained her side; with one backward dash of his
1318	foot capsized and sank his canoe; climbed up the chains; and throwing
1319	himself at full length upon the deck, grappled a ring-bolt there, and
1320	swore not to let it go, though hacked in pieces.
1321	
1322	In vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard; suspended a
1323	cutlass over his naked wrists; Queequeg was the son of a King, and
1324	Queequeg budged not.  Struck by his desperate dauntlessness, and his
1325	wild desire to visit Christendom, the captain at last relented, and
1326	told him he might make himself at home.  But this fine young
1327	savage--this sea Prince of Wales, never saw the Captain's cabin.
1328	They put him down among the sailors, and made a whaleman of him.  But
1329	like Czar Peter content to toil in the shipyards of foreign cities,
1330	Queequeg disdained no seeming ignominy, if thereby he might happily
1331	gain the power of enlightening his untutored countrymen.  For at
1332	bottom--so he told me--he was actuated by a profound desire to learn
1333	among the Christians, the arts whereby to make his people still
1334	happier than they were; and more than that, still better than they
1335	were.  But, alas! the practices of whalemen soon convinced him that
1336	even Christians could be both miserable and wicked; infinitely more
1337	so, than all his father's heathens.  Arrived at last in old Sag
1338	Harbor; and seeing what the sailors did there; and then going on to
1339	Nantucket, and seeing how they spent their wages in that place also,
1340	poor Queequeg gave it up for lost.  Thought he, it's a wicked world
1341	in all meridians; I'll die a pagan.
1342	
1343	And thus an old idolator at heart, he yet lived among these
1344	Christians, wore their clothes, and tried to talk their gibberish.
1345	Hence the queer ways about him, though now some time from home.
1346	
1347	By hints, I asked him whether he did not propose going back, and
1348	having a coronation; since he might now consider his father dead and
1349	gone, he being very old and feeble at the last accounts.  He answered
1350	no, not yet; and added that he was fearful Christianity, or rather
1351	Christians, had unfitted him for ascending the pure and undefiled
1352	throne of thirty pagan Kings before him.  But by and by, he said, he
1353	would return,--as soon as he felt himself baptized again.  For the
1354	nonce, however, he proposed to sail about, and sow his wild oats in
1355	all four oceans.  They had made a harpooneer of him, and that barbed
1356	iron was in lieu of a sceptre now.
1357	
1358	I asked him what might be his immediate purpose, touching his future
1359	movements.  He answered, to go to sea again, in his old vocation.
1360	Upon this, I told him that whaling was my own design, and informed
1361	him of my intention to sail out of Nantucket, as being the most
1362	promising port for an adventurous whaleman to embark from.  He at
1363	once resolved to accompany me to that island, ship aboard the same
1364	vessel, get into the same watch, the same boat, the same mess with
1365	me, in short to share my every hap; with both my hands in his, boldly
1366	dip into the Potluck of both worlds.  To all this I joyously
1367	assented; for besides the affection I now felt for Queequeg, he was
1368	an experienced harpooneer, and as such, could not fail to be of great
1369	usefulness to one, who, like me, was wholly ignorant of the mysteries
1370	of whaling, though well acquainted with the sea, as known to merchant
1371	seamen.
1372	
1373	His story being ended with his pipe's last dying puff, Queequeg
1374	embraced me, pressed his forehead against mine, and blowing out the
1375	light, we rolled over from each other, this way and that, and very
1376	soon were sleeping.
1377	
1378	
1379	CHAPTER 13
1380	
1381	Wheelbarrow.
1382	
1383	
1384	Next morning, Monday, after disposing of the embalmed head to a
1385	barber, for a block, I settled my own and comrade's bill; using,
1386	however, my comrade's money.  The grinning landlord, as well as the
1387	boarders, seemed amazingly tickled at the sudden friendship which had
1388	sprung up between me and Queequeg--especially as Peter Coffin's cock
1389	and bull stories about him had previously so much alarmed me
1390	concerning the very person whom I now companied with.
1391	
1392	We borrowed a wheelbarrow, and embarking our things, including my own
1393	poor carpet-bag, and Queequeg's canvas sack and hammock, away we went
1394	down to the Moss, the little Nantucket packet schooner moored at
1395	the wharf.  As we were going along the people stared; not at Queequeg
1396	so much--for they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their
1397	streets,--but at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms.  But
1398	we heeded them not, going along wheeling the barrow by turns, and
1399	Queequeg now and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon
1400	barbs.  I asked him why he carried such a troublesome thing with him
1401	ashore, and whether all whaling ships did not find their own
1402	harpoons.  To this, in substance, he replied, that though what I
1403	hinted was true enough, yet he had a particular affection for his own
1404	harpoon, because it was of assured stuff, well tried in many a mortal
1405	combat, and deeply intimate with the hearts of whales.  In short,
1406	like many inland reapers and mowers, who go into the farmers' meadows
1407	armed with their own scythes--though in no wise obliged to furnish
1408	them--even so, Queequeg, for his own private reasons, preferred his
1409	own harpoon.
1410	
1411	Shifting the barrow from my hand to his, he told me a funny story
1412	about the first wheelbarrow he had ever seen.  It was in Sag Harbor.
1413	The owners of his ship, it seems, had lent him one, in which to carry
1414	his heavy chest to his boarding house.  Not to seem ignorant about
1415	the thing--though in truth he was entirely so, concerning the precise
1416	way in which to manage the barrow--Queequeg puts his chest upon it;
1417	lashes it fast; and then shoulders the barrow and marches up the
1418	"wharf.  Why, said I, Queequeg, you might have known better than
that, one would think.  Didn't the people laugh?"
1419	
1420	Upon this, he told me another story.  The people of his island of
1421	Rokovoko, it seems, at their wedding feasts express the fragrant
1422	water of young cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a
1423	punchbowl; and this punchbowl always forms the great central ornament
1424	on the braided mat where the feast is held.  Now a certain grand
1425	merchant ship once touched at Rokovoko, and its commander--from all
1426	accounts, a very stately punctilious gentleman, at least for a sea
1427	captain--this commander was invited to the wedding feast of
1428	Queequeg's sister, a pretty young princess just turned of ten.  Well;
1429	when all the wedding guests were assembled at the bride's bamboo
1430	cottage, this Captain marches in, and being assigned the post of
1431	honour, placed himself over against the punchbowl, and between the
1432	High Priest and his majesty the King, Queequeg's father.  Grace being
1433	said,--for those people have their grace as well as we--though
1434	Queequeg told me that unlike us, who at such times look downwards to
1435	our platters, they, on the contrary, copying the ducks, glance
1436	upwards to the great Giver of all feasts--Grace, I say, being said,
1437	the High Priest opens the banquet by the immemorial ceremony of the
1438	island; that is, dipping his consecrated and consecrating fingers
1439	into the bowl before the blessed beverage circulates.  Seeing himself
1440	placed next the Priest, and noting the ceremony, and thinking
1441	himself--being Captain of a ship--as having plain precedence over a
1442	mere island King, especially in the King's own house--the Captain
1443	coolly proceeds to wash his hands in the punchbowl;--taking it I
1444	"suppose for a huge finger-glass.  Now, said Queequeg, what you
tink now?--Didn't our people laugh?"
1445	
1446	At last, passage paid, and luggage safe, we stood on board the
1447	schooner.  Hoisting sail, it glided down the Acushnet river.  On one
1448	side, New Bedford rose in terraces of streets, their ice-covered
1449	trees all glittering in the clear, cold air.  Huge hills and
1450	mountains of casks on casks were piled upon her wharves, and side by
1451	side the world-wandering whale ships lay silent and safely moored at
1452	last; while from others came a sound of carpenters and coopers, with
1453	blended noises of fires and forges to melt the pitch, all betokening
1454	that new cruises were on the start; that one most perilous and long
1455	voyage ended, only begins a second; and a second ended, only begins a
1456	third, and so on, for ever and for aye.  Such is the endlessness,
1457	yea, the intolerableness of all earthly effort.
1458	
1459	Gaining the more open water, the bracing breeze waxed fresh; the
1460	little Moss tossed the quick foam from her bows, as a young colt his
1461	snortings.  How I snuffed that Tartar air!--how I spurned that
1462	turnpike earth!--that common highway all over dented with the marks
1463	of slavish heels and hoofs; and turned me to admire the magnanimity
1464	of the sea which will permit no records.
1465	
1466	At the same foam-fountain, Queequeg seemed to drink and reel with me.
1467	His dusky nostrils swelled apart; he showed his filed and pointed
1468	teeth.  On, on we flew; and our offing gained, the Moss did homage to
1469	the blast; ducked and dived her bows as a slave before the Sultan.
1470	Sideways leaning, we sideways darted; every ropeyarn tingling like a
1471	wire; the two tall masts buckling like Indian canes in land
1472	tornadoes.  So full of this reeling scene were we, as we stood by the
1473	plunging bowsprit, that for some time we did not notice the jeering
1474	glances of the passengers, a lubber-like assembly, who marvelled that
1475	two fellow beings should be so companionable; as though a white man
1476	were anything more dignified than a whitewashed negro.  But there
1477	were some boobies and bumpkins there, who, by their intense
1478	greenness, must have come from the heart and centre of all verdure.
1479	Queequeg caught one of these young saplings mimicking him behind his
1480	back.  I thought the bumpkin's hour of doom was come.  Dropping his
1481	harpoon, the brawny savage caught him in his arms, and by an almost
1482	miraculous dexterity and strength, sent him high up bodily into the
1483	air; then slightly tapping his stern in mid-somerset, the fellow
1484	landed with bursting lungs upon his feet, while Queequeg, turning his
1485	back upon him, lighted his tomahawk pipe and passed it to me for a
1486	puff.
1487	
1488	"Capting!  Capting! yelled the bumpkin, running towards that officer;
Capting, Capting, here's the devil.

Hallo, YOU sir, cried the Captain, a gaunt rib of the sea, stalking
up to Queequeg, what in thunder do you mean by that?  Don't you know"
1489	"you might have killed that chap?

What him say? said Queequeg, as he mildly turned to me.

He say, said I, that you came near kill-e that man there,
pointing to the still shivering greenhorn.

Kill-e, cried Queequeg, twisting his tattooed face into an
unearthly expression of disdain, ah! him bevy small-e fish-e;"
1490	"Queequeg no kill-e so small-e fish-e; Queequeg kill-e big whale!

Look you, roared the Captain, I'll kill-e YOU, you cannibal, if"
1491	"you try any more of your tricks aboard here; so mind your eye.

But it so happened just then, that it was high time for the Captain
to mind his own eye.  The prodigious strain upon the main-sail had
parted the weather-sheet, and the tremendous boom was now flying from
side to side, completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck.
The poor fellow whom Queequeg had handled so roughly, was swept
overboard; all hands were in a panic; and to attempt snatching at the
boom to stay it, seemed madness.  It flew from right to left, and
back again, almost in one ticking of a watch, and every instant
seemed on the point of snapping into splinters.  Nothing was done,
and nothing seemed capable of being done; those on deck rushed
towards the bows, and stood eyeing the boom as if it were the lower
jaw of an exasperated whale.  In the midst of this consternation,
Queequeg dropped deftly to his knees, and crawling under the path of
the boom, whipped hold of a rope, secured one end to the bulwarks,
and then flinging the other like a lasso, caught it round the boom as
it swept over his head, and at the next jerk, the spar was that way
trapped, and all was safe.  The schooner was run into the wind, and
while the hands were clearing away the stern boat, Queequeg, stripped
to the waist, darted from the side with a long living arc of a leap.
For three minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog, throwing
his long arms straight out before him, and by turns revealing his
brawny shoulders through the freezing foam.  I looked at the grand
and glorious fellow, but saw no one to be saved.  The greenhorn had
gone down.  Shooting himself perpendicularly from the water,
Queequeg, now took an instant's glance around him, and seeming to see
just how matters were, dived down and disappeared.  A few minutes
more, and he rose again, one arm still striking out, and with the
other dragging a lifeless form.  The boat soon picked them up.  The
poor bumpkin was restored.  All hands voted Queequeg a noble trump;
the captain begged his pardon.  From that hour I clove to Queequeg
like a barnacle; yea, till poor Queequeg took his last long dive.

Was there ever such unconsciousness?  He did not seem to think that
he at all deserved a medal from the Humane and Magnanimous Societies.
He only asked for water--fresh water--something to wipe the brine
off; that done, he put on dry clothes, lighted his pipe, and leaning
against the bulwarks, and mildly eyeing those around him, seemed to
be saying to himself--It's a mutual, joint-stock world, in all"
1492	"meridians.  We cannibals must help these Christians.



CHAPTER 14

Nantucket.


Nothing more happened on the passage worthy the mentioning; so, after
a fine run, we safely arrived in Nantucket.

Nantucket!  Take out your map and look at it.  See what a real corner
of the world it occupies; how it stands there, away off shore, more
lonely than the Eddystone lighthouse.  Look at it--a mere hillock,
and elbow of sand; all beach, without a background.  There is more
sand there than you would use in twenty years as a substitute for
blotting paper.  Some gamesome wights will tell you that they have to
plant weeds there, they don't grow naturally; that they import Canada
thistles; that they have to send beyond seas for a spile to stop a
leak in an oil cask; that pieces of wood in Nantucket are carried
about like bits of the true cross in Rome; that people there plant
toadstools before their houses, to get under the shade in summer
time; that one blade of grass makes an oasis, three blades in a day's
walk a prairie; that they wear quicksand shoes, something like
Laplander snow-shoes; that they are so shut up, belted about, every
way inclosed, surrounded, and made an utter island of by the ocean,
that to their very chairs and tables small clams will sometimes be
found adhering, as to the backs of sea turtles.  But these
extravaganzas only show that Nantucket is no Illinois.

Look now at the wondrous traditional story of how this island was
settled by the red-men.  Thus goes the legend.  In olden times an
eagle swooped down upon the New England coast, and carried off an
infant Indian in his talons.  With loud lament the parents saw their
child borne out of sight over the wide waters.  They resolved to
follow in the same direction.  Setting out in their canoes, after a
perilous passage they discovered the island, and there they found an
empty ivory casket,--the poor little Indian's skeleton.

What wonder, then, that these Nantucketers, born on a beach, should
take to the sea for a livelihood!  They first caught crabs and
quohogs in the sand; grown bolder, they waded out with nets for
mackerel; more experienced, they pushed off in boats and captured
cod; and at last, launching a navy of great ships on the sea,
explored this watery world; put an incessant belt of
circumnavigations round it; peeped in at Behring's Straits; and in
all seasons and all oceans declared everlasting war with the
mightiest animated mass that has survived the flood; most monstrous
and most mountainous!  That Himmalehan, salt-sea Mastodon, clothed
with such portentousness of unconscious power, that his very panics
are more to be dreaded than his most fearless and malicious assaults!

And thus have these naked Nantucketers, these sea hermits, issuing
from their ant-hill in the sea, overrun and conquered the watery
world like so many Alexanders; parcelling out among them the
Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans, as the three pirate powers did
Poland.  Let America add Mexico to Texas, and pile Cuba upon Canada;
let the English overswarm all India, and hang out their blazing
banner from the sun; two thirds of this terraqueous globe are the
Nantucketer's.  For the sea is his; he owns it, as Emperors own
empires; other seamen having but a right of way through it.  Merchant
ships are but extension bridges; armed ones but floating forts; even
pirates and privateers, though following the sea as highwaymen the
road, they but plunder other ships, other fragments of the land like
themselves, without seeking to draw their living from the bottomless
deep itself.  The Nantucketer, he alone resides and riots on the sea;
he alone, in Bible language, goes down to it in ships; to and fro
ploughing it as his own special plantation.  THERE is his home; THERE
lies his business, which a Noah's flood would not interrupt, though
it overwhelmed all the millions in China.  He lives on the sea, as
prairie cocks in the prairie; he hides among the waves, he climbs
them as chamois hunters climb the Alps.  For years he knows not the
land; so that when he comes to it at last, it smells like another
world, more strangely than the moon would to an Earthsman.  With the
landless gull, that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep
between billows; so at nightfall, the Nantucketer, out of sight of
land, furls his sails, and lays him to his rest, while under his very
pillow rush herds of walruses and whales.



CHAPTER 15

Chowder.


It was quite late in the evening when the little Moss came snugly to
anchor, and Queequeg and I went ashore; so we could attend to no
business that day, at least none but a supper and a bed.  The
landlord of the Spouter-Inn had recommended us to his cousin Hosea
Hussey of the Try Pots, whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one
of the best kept hotels in all Nantucket, and moreover he had assured
us that Cousin Hosea, as he called him, was famous for his chowders.
In short, he plainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than
try pot-luck at the Try Pots.  But the directions he had given us
about keeping a yellow warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened
a white church to the larboard, and then keeping that on the larboard
hand till we made a corner three points to the starboard, and that
done, then ask the first man we met where the place was: these
crooked directions of his very much puzzled us at first, especially
as, at the outset, Queequeg insisted that the yellow warehouse--our
first point of departure--must be left on the larboard hand, whereas
I had understood Peter Coffin to say it was on the starboard.
However, by dint of beating about a little in the dark, and now and
then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant to inquire the way, we at
last came to something which there was no mistaking.

Two enormous wooden pots painted black, and suspended by asses' ears,
swung from the cross-trees of an old top-mast, planted in front of an
old doorway.  The horns of the cross-trees were sawed off on the
other side, so that this old top-mast looked not a little like a
gallows.  Perhaps I was over sensitive to such impressions at the
time, but I could not help staring at this gallows with a vague
misgiving.  A sort of crick was in my neck as I gazed up to the two
remaining horns; yes, TWO of them, one for Queequeg, and one for me.
It's ominous, thinks I.  A Coffin my Innkeeper upon landing in my
first whaling port; tombstones staring at me in the whalemen's
chapel; and here a gallows! and a pair of prodigious black pots too!
Are these last throwing out oblique hints touching Tophet?

I was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman
with yellow hair and a yellow gown, standing in the porch of the inn,
under a dull red lamp swinging there, that looked much like an
injured eye, and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple
woollen shirt.

Get along with ye, said she to the man, or I'll be combing ye!

Come on, Queequeg, said I, all right.  There's Mrs. Hussey.

And so it turned out; Mr. Hosea Hussey being from home, but leaving
Mrs. Hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs.  Upon
making known our desires for a supper and a bed, Mrs. Hussey,
postponing further scolding for the present, ushered us into a little
room, and seating us at a table spread with the relics of a recently
concluded repast, turned round to us and said--Clam or Cod?

What's that about Cods, ma'am? said I, with much politeness.

Clam or Cod? she repeated.

A clam for supper? a cold clam; is THAT what you mean, Mrs. Hussey?
says I, but that's a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter"
1493	"time, ain't it, Mrs. Hussey?

But being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple
Shirt, who was waiting for it in the entry, and seeming to hear
nothing but the word clam, Mrs. Hussey hurried towards an open door
leading to the kitchen, and bawling out clam for two, disappeared.

Queequeg, said I, do you think that we can make out a supper for"
1494	"us both on one clam?

However, a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the
apparently cheerless prospect before us.  But when that smoking
chowder came in, the mystery was delightfully explained.  Oh, sweet
friends! hearken to me.  It was made of small juicy clams, scarcely
bigger than hazel nuts, mixed with pounded ship biscuit, and salted
pork cut up into little flakes; the whole enriched with butter, and
plentifully seasoned with pepper and salt.  Our appetites being
sharpened by the frosty voyage, and in particular, Queequeg seeing
his favourite fishing food before him, and the chowder being
surpassingly excellent, we despatched it with great expedition: when
leaning back a moment and bethinking me of Mrs. Hussey's clam and cod
announcement, I thought I would try a little experiment.  Stepping to
the kitchen door, I uttered the word cod with great emphasis, and
resumed my seat.  In a few moments the savoury steam came forth
again, but with a different flavor, and in good time a fine
cod-chowder was placed before us.

We resumed business; and while plying our spoons in the bowl, thinks
I to myself, I wonder now if this here has any effect on the head?
What's that stultifying saying about chowder-headed people?  But"
1495	look, Queequeg, ain't that a live eel in your bowl?  Where's your
1496	"harpoon?

Fishiest of all fishy places was the Try Pots, which well deserved
its name; for the pots there were always boiling chowders.  Chowder
for breakfast, and chowder for dinner, and chowder for supper, till
you began to look for fish-bones coming through your clothes.  The
area before the house was paved with clam-shells.  Mrs. Hussey wore a
polished necklace of codfish vertebra; and Hosea Hussey had his
account books bound in superior old shark-skin.  There was a fishy
flavor to the milk, too, which I could not at all account for, till
one morning happening to take a stroll along the beach among some
fishermen's boats, I saw Hosea's brindled cow feeding on fish
remnants, and marching along the sand with each foot in a cod's
decapitated head, looking very slip-shod, I assure ye.

Supper concluded, we received a lamp, and directions from Mrs. Hussey
concerning the nearest way to bed; but, as Queequeg was about to
precede me up the stairs, the lady reached forth her arm, and
demanded his harpoon; she allowed no harpoon in her chambers.  Why"
1497	"not? said I; every true whaleman sleeps with his harpoon--but why
not?  Because it's dangerous, says she.  Ever since young Stiggs
coming from that unfort'nt v'y'ge of his, when he was gone four years
and a half, with only three barrels of ILE, was found dead in my
first floor back, with his harpoon in his side; ever since then I
allow no boarders to take sich dangerous weepons in their rooms at
night.  So, Mr. Queequeg (for she had learned his name), I will
just take this here iron, and keep it for you till morning.  But the
chowder; clam or cod to-morrow for breakfast, men?"
1498	
1499	"Both, says I; and let's have a couple of smoked herring by way of
variety."

1508	In bed we concocted our plans for the morrow.  But to my surprise and
1509	no small concern, Queequeg now gave me to understand, that he had
1510	been diligently consulting Yojo--the name of his black little
1511	god--and Yojo had told him two or three times over, and strongly
1512	insisted upon it everyway, that instead of our going together among
1513	the whaling-fleet in harbor, and in concert selecting our craft;
1514	instead of this, I say, Yojo earnestly enjoined that the selection of
1515	the ship should rest wholly with me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed
1516	befriending us; and, in order to do so, had already pitched upon a
1517	vessel, which, if left to myself, I, Ishmael, should infallibly light
1518	upon, for all the world as though it had turned out by chance; and in
1519	that vessel I must immediately ship myself, for the present
1520	irrespective of Queequeg.
1521	
1522	I have forgotten to mention that, in many things, Queequeg placed
1523	great confidence in the excellence of Yojo's judgment and surprising
1524	forecast of things; and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem, as a
1525	rather good sort of god, who perhaps meant well enough upon the
1526	whole, but in all cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs.
1527	
1528	Now, this plan of Queequeg's, or rather Yojo's, touching the
1529	selection of our craft; I did not like that plan at all.  I had not a
1530	little relied upon Queequeg's sagacity to point out the whaler best
1531	fitted to carry us and our fortunes securely.  But as all my
1532	remonstrances produced no effect upon Queequeg, I was obliged to
1533	acquiesce; and accordingly prepared to set about this business with a
1534	determined rushing sort of energy and vigor, that should quickly
1535	settle that trifling little affair.  Next morning early, leaving
1536	Queequeg shut up with Yojo in our little bedroom--for it seemed that
1537	it was some sort of Lent or Ramadan, or day of fasting, humiliation,
1538	and prayer with Queequeg and Yojo that day; HOW it was I never could
1539	find out, for, though I applied myself to it several times, I never
1540	could master his liturgies and XXXIX Articles--leaving Queequeg,
1541	then, fasting on his tomahawk pipe, and Yojo warming himself at his
1542	sacrificial fire of shavings, I sallied out among the shipping.
1543	After much prolonged sauntering and many random inquiries, I learnt
1544	that there were three ships up for three-years' voyages--The
1545	Devil-dam, the Tit-bit, and the Pequod.  DEVIL-DAM, I do not know
1546	the origin of; TIT-BIT is obvious; PEQUOD, you will no doubt
1547	remember, was the name of a celebrated tribe of Massachusetts
1548	Indians; now extinct as the ancient Medes.  I peered and pryed about
1549	the Devil-dam; from her, hopped over to the Tit-bit; and finally,
1550	going on board the Pequod, looked around her for a moment, and then
1551	decided that this was the very ship for us.
1552	
1553	You may have seen many a quaint craft in your day, for aught I
1554	know;--square-toed luggers; mountainous Japanese junks; butter-box
1555	galliots, and what not; but take my word for it, you never saw such a
1556	rare old craft as this same rare old Pequod.  She was a ship of the
1557	old school, rather small if anything; with an old-fashioned
1558	claw-footed look about her.  Long seasoned and weather-stained in the
1559	typhoons and calms of all four oceans, her old hull's complexion was
1560	darkened like a French grenadier's, who has alike fought in Egypt and
1561	Siberia.  Her venerable bows looked bearded.  Her masts--cut
1562	somewhere on the coast of Japan, where her original ones were lost
1563	overboard in a gale--her masts stood stiffly up like the spines of
1564	the three old kings of Cologne.  Her ancient decks were worn and
1565	wrinkled, like the pilgrim-worshipped flag-stone in Canterbury
1566	Cathedral where Becket bled.  But to all these her old antiquities,
1567	were added new and marvellous features, pertaining to the wild
1568	business that for more than half a century she had followed.  Old
1569	Captain Peleg, many years her chief-mate, before he commanded another
1570	vessel of his own, and now a retired seaman, and one of the principal
1571	owners of the Pequod,--this old Peleg, during the term of his
1572	chief-mateship, had built upon her original grotesqueness, and inlaid
1573	it, all over, with a quaintness both of material and device,
1574	unmatched by anything except it be Thorkill-Hake's carved buckler or
1575	bedstead.  She was apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian emperor,
1576	his neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory.  She was a thing of
1577	trophies.  A cannibal of a craft, tricking herself forth in the
1578	chased bones of her enemies.  All round, her unpanelled, open
1579	bulwarks were garnished like one continuous jaw, with the long sharp
1580	teeth of the sperm whale, inserted there for pins, to fasten her old
1581	hempen thews and tendons to.  Those thews ran not through base blocks
1582	of land wood, but deftly travelled over sheaves of sea-ivory.
1583	Scorning a turnstile wheel at her reverend helm, she sported there a
1584	tiller; and that tiller was in one mass, curiously carved from the
1585	long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe.  The helmsman who
1586	steered by that tiller in a tempest, felt like the Tartar, when he
1587	holds back his fiery steed by clutching its jaw.  A noble craft, but
1588	somehow a most melancholy!  All noble things are touched with that.
1589	
1590	Now when I looked about the quarter-deck, for some one having
1591	authority, in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage,
1592	at first I saw nobody; but I could not well overlook a strange sort
1593	of tent, or rather wigwam, pitched a little behind the main-mast.  It
1594	seemed only a temporary erection used in port.  It was of a conical
1595	shape, some ten feet high; consisting of the long, huge slabs of
1596	limber black bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws
1597	of the right-whale.  Planted with their broad ends on the deck, a
1598	circle of these slabs laced together, mutually sloped towards each
1599	other, and at the apex united in a tufted point, where the loose
1600	hairy fibres waved to and fro like the top-knot on some old
1601	Pottowottamie Sachem's head.  A triangular opening faced towards the
1602	bows of the ship, so that the insider commanded a complete view
1603	forward.
1604	
1605	And half concealed in this queer tenement, I at length found one who
1606	by his aspect seemed to have authority; and who, it being noon, and
1607	the ship's work suspended, was now enjoying respite from the burden
1608	of command.  He was seated on an old-fashioned oaken chair, wriggling
1609	all over with curious carving; and the bottom of which was formed of
1610	a stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was
1611	constructed.
1612	
1613	There was nothing so very particular, perhaps, about the appearance
1614	of the elderly man I saw; he was brown and brawny, like most old
1615	seamen, and heavily rolled up in blue pilot-cloth, cut in the Quaker
1616	style; only there was a fine and almost microscopic net-work of the
1617	minutest wrinkles interlacing round his eyes, which must have arisen
1618	from his continual sailings in many hard gales, and always looking to
1619	windward;--for this causes the muscles about the eyes to become
1620	pursed together.  Such eye-wrinkles are very effectual in a scowl.
1621	
1622	Is this the Captain of the Pequod? said I, advancing to the door of
1623	the tent.
1624	
1625	"Supposing it be the captain of the Pequod, what dost thou want of
him? he demanded."
1626	
1627	I was thinking of shipping.
1628	
1629	"Thou wast, wast thou?  I see thou art no Nantucketer--ever been in
a stove boat?"
1630	
1631	No, Sir, I never have.
1632	
1633	"Dost know nothing at all about whaling, I dare say--eh?

Nothing, Sir; but I have no doubt I shall soon learn.  I've been"
1634	"several voyages in the merchant service, and I think that--

Merchant service be damned.  Talk not that lingo to me.  Dost see"
1635	that leg?--I'll take that leg away from thy stern, if ever thou
1636	talkest of the marchant service to me again.  Marchant service
1637	indeed!  I suppose now ye feel considerable proud of having served in
1638	those marchant ships.  But flukes! man, what makes thee want to go a
1639	whaling, eh?--it looks a little suspicious, don't it, eh?--Hast not
1640	been a pirate, hast thou?--Didst not rob thy last Captain, didst
1641	thou?--Dost not think of murdering the officers when thou gettest to
1642	"sea?

I protested my innocence of these things.  I saw that under the mask
of these half humorous innuendoes, this old seaman, as an insulated
Quakerish Nantucketer, was full of his insular prejudices, and rather
distrustful of all aliens, unless they hailed from Cape Cod or the
Vineyard.

But what takes thee a-whaling?  I want to know that before I think"
1643	"of shipping ye.

Well, sir, I want to see what whaling is.  I want to see the world.

Want to see what whaling is, eh?  Have ye clapped eye on Captain"
1644	"Ahab?

Who is Captain Ahab, sir?

Aye, aye, I thought so.  Captain Ahab is the Captain of this ship.

I am mistaken then.  I thought I was speaking to the Captain"
1645	"himself.

Thou art speaking to Captain Peleg--that's who ye are speaking to,"
1646	young man.  It belongs to me and Captain Bildad to see the Pequod
1647	fitted out for the voyage, and supplied with all her needs, including
1648	crew.  We are part owners and agents.  But as I was going to say, if
1649	thou wantest to know what whaling is, as thou tellest ye do, I can
1650	put ye in a way of finding it out before ye bind yourself to it, past
1651	backing out.  Clap eye on Captain Ahab, young man, and thou wilt find
1652	"that he has only one leg.

What do you mean, sir?  Was the other one lost by a whale?

Lost by a whale!  Young man, come nearer to me: it was devoured,"
1653	chewed up, crunched by the monstrousest parmacetty that ever chipped
1654	"a boat!--ah, ah!

I was a little alarmed by his energy, perhaps also a little touched
at the hearty grief in his concluding exclamation, but said as calmly
as I could, What you say is no doubt true enough, sir; but how could"
1655	I know there was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale,
1656	though indeed I might have inferred as much from the simple fact of
1657	"the accident.

Look ye now, young man, thy lungs are a sort of soft, d'ye see; thou"
1658	dost not talk shark a bit.  SURE, ye've been to sea before now; sure
1659	"of that?

Sir, said I, I thought I told you that I had been four voyages in"
1660	"the merchant--

Hard down out of that!  Mind what I said about the marchant"
1661	service--don't aggravate me--I won't have it.  But let us understand
1662	each other.  I have given thee a hint about what whaling is; do ye
1663	"yet feel inclined for it?

I do, sir.

Very good.  Now, art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live"
1664	"whale's throat, and then jump after it?  Answer, quick!

I am, sir, if it should be positively indispensable to do so; not to"
1665	"be got rid of, that is; which I don't take to be the fact.

Good again.  Now then, thou not only wantest to go a-whaling, to"
1666	find out by experience what whaling is, but ye also want to go in
1667	order to see the world?  Was not that what ye said?  I thought so.
1668	Well then, just step forward there, and take a peep over the
1669	"weather-bow, and then back to me and tell me what ye see there.

For a moment I stood a little puzzled by this curious request, not
knowing exactly how to take it, whether humorously or in earnest.
But concentrating all his crow's feet into one scowl, Captain Peleg
started me on the errand.

Going forward and glancing over the weather bow, I perceived that the
ship swinging to her anchor with the flood-tide, was now obliquely
pointing towards the open ocean.  The prospect was unlimited, but
exceedingly monotonous and forbidding; not the slightest variety that
I could see.

Well, what's the report? said Peleg when I came back; what did ye"
1670	"see?

Not much, I replied--nothing but water; considerable horizon"
1671	"though, and there's a squall coming up, I think.

Well, what does thou think then of seeing the world?  Do ye wish to"
1672	go round Cape Horn to see any more of it, eh?  Can't ye see the world
1673	"where you stand?

I was a little staggered, but go a-whaling I must, and I would; and
the Pequod was as good a ship as any--I thought the best--and all
this I now repeated to Peleg.  Seeing me so determined, he expressed
his willingness to ship me.

And thou mayest as well sign the papers right off, he added--come"
1674	"along with ye.  And so saying, he led the way below deck into the
cabin.

Seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and
surprising figure.  It turned out to be Captain Bildad, who along
with Captain Peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel; the
other shares, as is sometimes the case in these ports, being held by
a crowd of old annuitants; widows, fatherless children, and chancery
wards; each owning about the value of a timber head, or a foot of
plank, or a nail or two in the ship.  People in Nantucket invest
their money in whaling vessels, the same way that you do yours in
approved state stocks bringing in good interest.

Now, Bildad, like Peleg, and indeed many other Nantucketers, was a
Quaker, the island having been originally settled by that sect; and
to this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure
the peculiarities of the Quaker, only variously and anomalously
modified by things altogether alien and heterogeneous.  For some of
these same Quakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and
whale-hunters.  They are fighting Quakers; they are Quakers with a
vengeance.

So that there are instances among them of men, who, named with
Scripture names--a singularly common fashion on the island--and in
childhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of
the Quaker idiom; still, from the audacious, daring, and boundless
adventure of their subsequent lives, strangely blend with these
unoutgrown peculiarities, a thousand bold dashes of character, not
unworthy a Scandinavian sea-king, or a poetical Pagan Roman.  And
when these things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force,
with a globular brain and a ponderous heart; who has also by the
stillness and seclusion of many long night-watches in the remotest
waters, and beneath constellations never seen here at the north, been
led to think untraditionally and independently; receiving all
nature's sweet or savage impressions fresh from her own virgin
voluntary and confiding breast, and thereby chiefly, but with some
help from accidental advantages, to learn a bold and nervous lofty
language--that man makes one in a whole nation's census--a mighty
pageant creature, formed for noble tragedies.  Nor will it at all
detract from him, dramatically regarded, if either by birth or other
circumstances, he have what seems a half wilful overruling morbidness
at the bottom of his nature.  For all men tragically great are made
so through a certain morbidness.  Be sure of this, O young ambition,
all mortal greatness is but disease.  But, as yet we have not to do
with such an one, but with quite another; and still a man, who, if
indeed peculiar, it only results again from another phase of the
Quaker, modified by individual circumstances.

Like Captain Peleg, Captain Bildad was a well-to-do, retired
whaleman.  But unlike Captain Peleg--who cared not a rush for what
are called serious things, and indeed deemed those self-same serious
things the veriest of all trifles--Captain Bildad had not only been
originally educated according to the strictest sect of Nantucket
Quakerism, but all his subsequent ocean life, and the sight of many
unclad, lovely island creatures, round the Horn--all that had not
moved this native born Quaker one single jot, had not so much as
altered one angle of his vest.  Still, for all this immutableness,
was there some lack of common consistency about worthy Captain
Peleg.  Though refusing, from conscientious scruples, to bear arms
against land invaders, yet himself had illimitably invaded the
Atlantic and Pacific; and though a sworn foe to human bloodshed, yet
had he in his straight-bodied coat, spilled tuns upon tuns of
leviathan gore.  How now in the contemplative evening of his days,
the pious Bildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence, I do
not know; but it did not seem to concern him much, and very probably
he had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a
man's religion is one thing, and this practical world quite another.
This world pays dividends.  Rising from a little cabin-boy in short
clothes of the drabbest drab, to a harpooneer in a broad shad-bellied
waistcoat; from that becoming boat-header, chief-mate, and captain,
and finally a ship owner; Bildad, as I hinted before, had concluded
his adventurous career by wholly retiring from active life at the
goodly age of sixty, and dedicating his remaining days to the quiet
receiving of his well-earned income.

Now, Bildad, I am sorry to say, had the reputation of being an
incorrigible old hunks, and in his sea-going days, a bitter, hard
task-master.  They told me in Nantucket, though it certainly seems a
curious story, that when he sailed the old Categut whaleman, his
crew, upon arriving home, were mostly all carried ashore to the
hospital, sore exhausted and worn out.  For a pious man, especially
for a Quaker, he was certainly rather hard-hearted, to say the
least.  He never used to swear, though, at his men, they said; but
somehow he got an inordinate quantity of cruel, unmitigated hard work
out of them.  When Bildad was a chief-mate, to have his drab-coloured
eye intently looking at you, made you feel completely nervous, till
you could clutch something--a hammer or a marling-spike, and go to
work like mad, at something or other, never mind what.  Indolence and
idleness perished before him.  His own person was the exact
embodiment of his utilitarian character.  On his long, gaunt body, he
carried no spare flesh, no superfluous beard, his chin having a soft,
economical nap to it, like the worn nap of his broad-brimmed hat.

Such, then, was the person that I saw seated on the transom when I
followed Captain Peleg down into the cabin.  The space between the
decks was small; and there, bolt-upright, sat old Bildad, who always
sat so, and never leaned, and this to save his coat tails.  His
broad-brim was placed beside him; his legs were stiffly crossed; his
drab vesture was buttoned up to his chin; and spectacles on nose, he
seemed absorbed in reading from a ponderous volume.

Bildad, cried Captain Peleg, at it again, Bildad, eh?  Ye have"
1675	been studying those Scriptures, now, for the last thirty years, to my
1676	"certain knowledge.  How far ye got, Bildad?

As if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate,
Bildad, without noticing his present irreverence, quietly looked up,
and seeing me, glanced again inquiringly towards Peleg.

He says he's our man, Bildad, said Peleg, he wants to ship.

Dost thee? said Bildad, in a hollow tone, and turning round to me.

I dost, said I unconsciously, he was so intense a Quaker.

What do ye think of him, Bildad? said Peleg.

He'll do, said Bildad, eyeing me, and then went on spelling away at
his book in a mumbling tone quite audible.

I thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw, especially as
Peleg, his friend and old shipmate, seemed such a blusterer.  But I
said nothing, only looking round me sharply.  Peleg now threw open a
chest, and drawing forth the ship's articles, placed pen and ink
before him, and seated himself at a little table.  I began to think
it was high time to settle with myself at what terms I would be
willing to engage for the voyage.  I was already aware that in the
whaling business they paid no wages; but all hands, including the
captain, received certain shares of the profits called lays, and that
these lays were proportioned to the degree of importance pertaining
to the respective duties of the ship's company.  I was also aware
that being a green hand at whaling, my own lay would not be very
large; but considering that I was used to the sea, could steer a
ship, splice a rope, and all that, I made no doubt that from all I
had heard I should be offered at least the 275th lay--that is, the
275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage, whatever that
might eventually amount to.  And though the 275th lay was what they
call a rather LONG LAY, yet it was better than nothing; and if we had
a lucky voyage, might pretty nearly pay for the clothing I would wear
out on it, not to speak of my three years' beef and board, for which
I would not have to pay one stiver.

It might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely
fortune--and so it was, a very poor way indeed.  But I am one of
those that never take on about princely fortunes, and am quite
content if the world is ready to board and lodge me, while I am
putting up at this grim sign of the Thunder Cloud.  Upon the whole, I
thought that the 275th lay would be about the fair thing, but would not
have been surprised had I been offered the 200th, considering I was
of a broad-shouldered make.

But one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful about
receiving a generous share of the profits was this: Ashore, I had
heard something of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony
Bildad; how that they being the principal proprietors of the Pequod,
therefore the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners,
left nearly the whole management of the ship's affairs to these two.
And I did not know but what the stingy old Bildad might have a mighty
deal to say about shipping hands, especially as I now found him on
board the Pequod, quite at home there in the cabin, and reading his
Bible as if at his own fireside.  Now while Peleg was vainly trying
to mend a pen with his jack-knife, old Bildad, to my no small
surprise, considering that he was such an interested party in these
proceedings; Bildad never heeded us, but went on mumbling to himself
out of his book, LAY not up for yourselves treasures upon earth,"
1677	"where moth--

Well, Captain Bildad, interrupted Peleg, what d'ye say, what lay"
1678	"shall we give this young man?

Thou knowest best, was the sepulchral reply, the seven hundred and"
1679	seventy-seventh wouldn't be too much, would it?--'where moth and rust
1680	"do corrupt, but LAY--'

LAY, indeed, thought I, and such a lay! the seven hundred and
seventy-seventh!  Well, old Bildad, you are determined that I, for
one, shall not LAY up many LAYS here below, where moth and rust do
corrupt.  It was an exceedingly LONG LAY that, indeed; and though
from the magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a
landsman, yet the slightest consideration will show that though seven
hundred and seventy-seven is a pretty large number, yet, when you
come to make a TEENTH of it, you will then see, I say, that the seven
hundred and seventy-seventh part of a farthing is a good deal less
than seven hundred and seventy-seven gold doubloons; and so I thought
at the time.

Why, blast your eyes, Bildad, cried Peleg, thou dost not want to"
1681	"swindle this young man! he must have more than that.

Seven hundred and seventy-seventh, again said Bildad, without
lifting his eyes; and then went on mumbling--for where your treasure"
1682	"is, there will your heart be also.

I am going to put him down for the three hundredth, said Peleg, do"
1683	"ye hear that, Bildad!  The three hundredth lay, I say.

Bildad laid down his book, and turning solemnly towards him said,
Captain Peleg, thou hast a generous heart; but thou must consider"
1684	the duty thou owest to the other owners of this ship--widows and
1685	orphans, many of them--and that if we too abundantly reward the
1686	labors of this young man, we may be taking the bread from those
1687	widows and those orphans.  The seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay,
1688	"Captain Peleg.

Thou Bildad! roared Peleg, starting up and clattering about the
cabin.  Blast ye, Captain Bildad, if I had followed thy advice in"
1689	these matters, I would afore now had a conscience to lug about that
1690	would be heavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed
1691	"round Cape Horn.

Captain Peleg, said Bildad steadily, thy conscience may be drawing"
1692	ten inches of water, or ten fathoms, I can't tell; but as thou art
1693	still an impenitent man, Captain Peleg, I greatly fear lest thy
1694	conscience be but a leaky one; and will in the end sink thee
1695	"foundering down to the fiery pit, Captain Peleg.

Fiery pit! fiery pit! ye insult me, man; past all natural bearing,"
1696	ye insult me.  It's an all-fired outrage to tell any human creature
1697	that he's bound to hell.  Flukes and flames!  Bildad, say that again
1698	to me, and start my soul-bolts, but I'll--I'll--yes, I'll swallow a
1699	live goat with all his hair and horns on.  Out of the cabin, ye
1700	"canting, drab-coloured son of a wooden gun--a straight wake with ye!

As he thundered out this he made a rush at Bildad, but with a
marvellous oblique, sliding celerity, Bildad for that time eluded
him.

Alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and
responsible owners of the ship, and feeling half a mind to give up
all idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily
commanded, I stepped aside from the door to give egress to Bildad,
who, I made no doubt, was all eagerness to vanish from before the
awakened wrath of Peleg.  But to my astonishment, he sat down again
on the transom very quietly, and seemed to have not the slightest
intention of withdrawing.  He seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg
and his ways.  As for Peleg, after letting off his rage as he had,
there seemed no more left in him, and he, too, sat down like a lamb,
though he twitched a little as if still nervously agitated.  Whew!
he whistled at last--the squall's gone off to leeward, I think."
1701	Bildad, thou used to be good at sharpening a lance, mend that pen,
1702	will ye.  My jack-knife here needs the grindstone.  That's he; thank
1703	ye, Bildad.  Now then, my young man, Ishmael's thy name, didn't ye
1704	say?  Well then, down ye go here, Ishmael, for the three hundredth
1705	"lay.

Captain Peleg, said I, I have a friend with me who wants to ship"
1706	"too--shall I bring him down to-morrow?

To be sure, said Peleg.  Fetch him along, and we'll look at him.

What lay does he want? groaned Bildad, glancing up from the book
in which he had again been burying himself.

Oh! never thee mind about that, Bildad, said Peleg.  Has he ever"
1707	"whaled it any? turning to me.

Killed more whales than I can count, Captain Peleg.

Well, bring him along then.

And, after signing the papers, off I went; nothing doubting but that
I had done a good morning's work, and that the Pequod was the
identical ship that Yojo had provided to carry Queequeg and me round
the Cape.

But I had not proceeded far, when I began to bethink me that the
Captain with whom I was to sail yet remained unseen by me; though,
indeed, in many cases, a whale-ship will be completely fitted out,
and receive all her crew on board, ere the captain makes himself
visible by arriving to take command; for sometimes these voyages are
so prolonged, and the shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief,
that if the captain have a family, or any absorbing concernment of
that sort, he does not trouble himself much about his ship in port,
but leaves her to the owners till all is ready for sea.  However, it
is always as well to have a look at him before irrevocably committing
yourself into his hands.  Turning back I accosted Captain Peleg,
inquiring where Captain Ahab was to be found.

And what dost thou want of Captain Ahab?  It's all right enough;"
1708	"thou art shipped.

Yes, but I should like to see him.

But I don't think thou wilt be able to at present.  I don't know"
1709	exactly what's the matter with him; but he keeps close inside the
1710	house; a sort of sick, and yet he don't look so.  In fact, he ain't
1711	sick; but no, he isn't well either.  Any how, young man, he won't
1712	always see me, so I don't suppose he will thee.  He's a queer man,
1713	Captain Ahab--so some think--but a good one.  Oh, thou'lt like him
1714	well enough; no fear, no fear.  He's a grand, ungodly, god-like man,
1715	Captain Ahab; doesn't speak much; but, when he does speak, then you
1716	may well listen.  Mark ye, be forewarned; Ahab's above the common;
1717	Ahab's been in colleges, as well as 'mong the cannibals; been used to
1718	deeper wonders than the waves; fixed his fiery lance in mightier,
1719	stranger foes than whales.  His lance! aye, the keenest and the surest
1720	that out of all our isle!  Oh! he ain't Captain Bildad; no, and he
1721	ain't Captain Peleg; HE'S AHAB, boy; and Ahab of old, thou knowest,
1722	"was a crowned king!

And a very vile one.  When that wicked king was slain, the dogs, did"
1723	"they not lick his blood?

Come hither to me--hither, hither, said Peleg, with a significance
in his eye that almost startled me.  Look ye, lad; never say that on"
1724	board the Pequod.  Never say it anywhere.  Captain Ahab did not name
1725	himself.  'Twas a foolish, ignorant whim of his crazy, widowed
1726	mother, who died when he was only a twelvemonth old.  And yet the old
1727	squaw Tistig, at Gayhead, said that the name would somehow prove
1728	prophetic.  And, perhaps, other fools like her may tell thee the
1729	same.  I wish to warn thee.  It's a lie.  I know Captain Ahab well;
1730	I've sailed with him as mate years ago; I know what he is--a good
1731	man--not a pious, good man, like Bildad, but a swearing good
1732	man--something like me--only there's a good deal more of him.  Aye,
1733	aye, I know that he was never very jolly; and I know that on the
1734	passage home, he was a little out of his mind for a spell; but it was
1735	the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that brought that
1736	about, as any one might see.  I know, too, that ever since he lost
1737	his leg last voyage by that accursed whale, he's been a kind of
1738	moody--desperate moody, and savage sometimes; but that will all pass
1739	off.  And once for all, let me tell thee and assure thee, young man,
1740	it's better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad
1741	one.  So good-bye to thee--and wrong not Captain Ahab, because he
1742	happens to have a wicked name.  Besides, my boy, he has a wife--not
1743	three voyages wedded--a sweet, resigned girl.  Think of that; by that
1744	sweet girl that old man has a child: hold ye then there can be any
1745	utter, hopeless harm in Ahab?  No, no, my lad; stricken, blasted, if
1746	"he be, Ahab has his humanities!

As I walked away, I was full of thoughtfulness; what had been
incidentally revealed to me of Captain Ahab, filled me with a certain
wild vagueness of painfulness concerning him.  And somehow, at the
time, I felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him, but for I don't know
what, unless it was the cruel loss of his leg.  And yet I also felt a
strange awe of him; but that sort of awe, which I cannot at all
describe, was not exactly awe; I do not know what it was.  But I felt
it; and it did not disincline me towards him; though I felt
impatience at what seemed like mystery in him, so imperfectly as he
was known to me then.  However, my thoughts were at length carried in
other directions, so that for the present dark Ahab slipped my mind.



CHAPTER 17

The Ramadan.


As Queequeg's Ramadan, or Fasting and Humiliation, was to continue
all day, I did not choose to disturb him till towards night-fall; for
I cherish the greatest respect towards everybody's religious
obligations, never mind how comical, and could not find it in my
heart to undervalue even a congregation of ants worshipping a
toad-stool; or those other creatures in certain parts of our earth,
who with a degree of footmanism quite unprecedented in other planets,
bow down before the torso of a deceased landed proprietor merely on
account of the inordinate possessions yet owned and rented in his
name.

I say, we good Presbyterian Christians should be charitable in these
things, and not fancy ourselves so vastly superior to other mortals,
pagans and what not, because of their half-crazy conceits on these
subjects.  There was Queequeg, now, certainly entertaining the most
absurd notions about Yojo and his Ramadan;--but what of that?
Queequeg thought he knew what he was about, I suppose; he seemed to
be content; and there let him rest.  All our arguing with him would
not avail; let him be, I say: and Heaven have mercy on us
all--Presbyterians and Pagans alike--for we are all somehow
dreadfully cracked about the head, and sadly need mending.

Towards evening, when I felt assured that all his performances and
rituals must be over, I went up to his room and knocked at the door;
but no answer.  I tried to open it, but it was fastened inside.
Queequeg, said I softly through the key-hole:--all silent.  I say,"
1747	"Queequeg! why don't you speak?  It's I--Ishmael.  But all remained
still as before.  I began to grow alarmed.  I had allowed him such
abundant time; I thought he might have had an apoplectic fit.  I
looked through the key-hole; but the door opening into an odd corner
of the room, the key-hole prospect was but a crooked and sinister
one.  I could only see part of the foot-board of the bed and a line
of the wall, but nothing more.  I was surprised to behold resting
against the wall the wooden shaft of Queequeg's harpoon, which the
landlady the evening previous had taken from him, before our mounting
to the chamber.  That's strange, thought I; but at any rate, since
the harpoon stands yonder, and he seldom or never goes abroad without
it, therefore he must be inside here, and no possible mistake.

Queequeg!--Queequeg!--all still.  Something must have happened.
Apoplexy!  I tried to burst open the door; but it stubbornly
resisted.  Running down stairs, I quickly stated my suspicions to the
first person I met--the chamber-maid.  La! la! she cried, I"
1748	thought something must be the matter.  I went to make the bed after
1749	breakfast, and the door was locked; and not a mouse to be heard; and
1750	it's been just so silent ever since.  But I thought, may be, you had
1751	both gone off and locked your baggage in for safe keeping.  La! la,
1752	"ma'am!--Mistress! murder!  Mrs. Hussey! apoplexy!--and with these
cries, she ran towards the kitchen, I following.

Mrs. Hussey soon appeared, with a mustard-pot in one hand and a
vinegar-cruet in the other, having just broken away from the
occupation of attending to the castors, and scolding her little black
boy meantime.

Wood-house! cried I, which way to it?  Run for God's sake, and"
1753	fetch something to pry open the door--the axe!--the axe! he's had a
1754	"stroke; depend upon it!--and so saying I was unmethodically rushing
up stairs again empty-handed, when Mrs. Hussey interposed the
mustard-pot and vinegar-cruet, and the entire castor of her
countenance.

What's the matter with you, young man?

Get the axe!  For God's sake, run for the doctor, some one, while I"
1755	"pry it open!

Look here, said the landlady, quickly putting down the
vinegar-cruet, so as to have one hand free; look here; are you"
1756	"talking about prying open any of my doors?--and with that she seized
my arm.  What's the matter with you?  What's the matter with you,"
1757	"shipmate?

In as calm, but rapid a manner as possible, I gave her to understand
the whole case.  Unconsciously clapping the vinegar-cruet to one side
of her nose, she ruminated for an instant; then exclaimed--No!  I"
1758	"haven't seen it since I put it there.  Running to a little closet
under the landing of the stairs, she glanced in, and returning, told
me that Queequeg's harpoon was missing.  He's killed himself, she
cried.  It's unfort'nate Stiggs done over again there goes another"
1759	counterpane--God pity his poor mother!--it will be the ruin of my
1760	house.  Has the poor lad a sister?  Where's that girl?--there, Betty,
1761	"go to Snarles the Painter, and tell him to paint me a sign, with--no
suicides permitted here, and no smoking in the parlor;--might as"
1762	well kill both birds at once.  Kill?  The Lord be merciful to his
1763	"ghost!  What's that noise there?  You, young man, avast there!

And running up after me, she caught me as I was again trying to force
open the door.

I don't allow it; I won't have my premises spoiled.  Go for the"
1764	"locksmith, there's one about a mile from here.  But avast! putting
her hand in her side-pocket, here's a key that'll fit, I guess;"
1765	"let's see.  And with that, she turned it in the lock; but, alas!
Queequeg's supplemental bolt remained unwithdrawn within.

Have to burst it open, said I, and was running down the entry a
little, for a good start, when the landlady caught at me, again
vowing I should not break down her premises; but I tore from her, and
with a sudden bodily rush dashed myself full against the mark.

With a prodigious noise the door flew open, and the knob slamming
against the wall, sent the plaster to the ceiling; and there, good
heavens! there sat Queequeg, altogether cool and self-collected;
right in the middle of the room; squatting on his hams, and holding
Yojo on top of his head.  He looked neither one way nor the other
way, but sat like a carved image with scarce a sign of active life.

Queequeg, said I, going up to him, Queequeg, what's the matter"
1766	"with you?

He hain't been a sittin' so all day, has he? said the landlady.

But all we said, not a word could we drag out of him; I almost felt
like pushing him over, so as to change his position, for it was
almost intolerable, it seemed so painfully and unnaturally
constrained; especially, as in all probability he had been sitting so
for upwards of eight or ten hours, going too without his regular
meals.

Mrs. Hussey, said I, he's ALIVE at all events; so leave us, if you"
1767	"please, and I will see to this strange affair myself.

Closing the door upon the landlady, I endeavored to prevail upon
Queequeg to take a chair; but in vain.  There he sat; and all he
could do--for all my polite arts and blandishments--he would not move
a peg, nor say a single word, nor even look at me, nor notice my
presence in the slightest way.

I wonder, thought I, if this can possibly be a part of his Ramadan;
do they fast on their hams that way in his native island.  It must be
so; yes, it's part of his creed, I suppose; well, then, let him
rest; he'll get up sooner or later, no doubt.  It can't last for
ever, thank God, and his Ramadan only comes once a year; and I don't
believe it's very punctual then.

I went down to supper.  After sitting a long time listening to the
long stories of some sailors who had just come from a plum-pudding
voyage, as they called it (that is, a short whaling-voyage in a
schooner or brig, confined to the north of the line, in the Atlantic
Ocean only); after listening to these plum-puddingers till nearly
eleven o'clock, I went up stairs to go to bed, feeling quite sure by
this time Queequeg must certainly have brought his Ramadan to a
termination.  But no; there he was just where I had left him; he had
not stirred an inch.  I began to grow vexed with him; it seemed so
downright senseless and insane to be sitting there all day and half
the night on his hams in a cold room, holding a piece of wood on his
head.

For heaven's sake, Queequeg, get up and shake yourself; get up and"
1768	"have some supper.  You'll starve; you'll kill yourself, Queequeg.
But not a word did he reply.

Despairing of him, therefore, I determined to go to bed and to sleep;
and no doubt, before a great while, he would follow me.  But previous
to turning in, I took my heavy bearskin jacket, and threw it over
him, as it promised to be a very cold night; and he had nothing but
his ordinary round jacket on.  For some time, do all I would, I could
not get into the faintest doze.  I had blown out the candle; and the
mere thought of Queequeg--not four feet off--sitting there in that
uneasy position, stark alone in the cold and dark; this made me
really wretched.  Think of it; sleeping all night in the same room
with a wide awake pagan on his hams in this dreary, unaccountable
Ramadan!

But somehow I dropped off at last, and knew nothing more till break
of day; when, looking over the bedside, there squatted Queequeg, as
if he had been screwed down to the floor.  But as soon as the first
glimpse of sun entered the window, up he got, with stiff and grating
joints, but with a cheerful look; limped towards me where I lay;
pressed his forehead again against mine; and said his Ramadan was
over.

Now, as I before hinted, I have no objection to any person's
religion, be it what it may, so long as that person does not kill or
insult any other person, because that other person don't believe it
also.  But when a man's religion becomes really frantic; when it is a
positive torment to him; and, in fine, makes this earth of ours an
uncomfortable inn to lodge in; then I think it high time to take that
individual aside and argue the point with him.

And just so I now did with Queequeg.  Queequeg, said I, get into"
1769	"bed now, and lie and listen to me.  I then went on, beginning with
the rise and progress of the primitive religions, and coming down to
the various religions of the present time, during which time I
labored to show Queequeg that all these Lents, Ramadans, and
prolonged ham-squattings in cold, cheerless rooms were stark
nonsense; bad for the health; useless for the soul; opposed, in
short, to the obvious laws of Hygiene and common sense.  I told him,
too, that he being in other things such an extremely sensible and
sagacious savage, it pained me, very badly pained me, to see him now
so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous Ramadan of his.  Besides,
argued I, fasting makes the body cave in; hence the spirit caves in;
and all thoughts born of a fast must necessarily be half-starved.
This is the reason why most dyspeptic religionists cherish such
melancholy notions about their hereafters.  In one word, Queequeg,
said I, rather digressively; hell is an idea first born on an
undigested apple-dumpling; and since then perpetuated through the
hereditary dyspepsias nurtured by Ramadans.

I then asked Queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled with
dyspepsia; expressing the idea very plainly, so that he could take it
in.  He said no; only upon one memorable occasion.  It was after a
great feast given by his father the king, on the gaining of a great
battle wherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two
o'clock in the afternoon, and all cooked and eaten that very evening.

No more, Queequeg, said I, shuddering; that will do; for I knew
the inferences without his further hinting them.  I had seen a sailor
who had visited that very island, and he told me that it was the
custom, when a great battle had been gained there, to barbecue all
the slain in the yard or garden of the victor; and then, one by one,
they were placed in great wooden trenchers, and garnished round like
a pilau, with breadfruit and cocoanuts; and with some parsley in
their mouths, were sent round with the victor's compliments to all
his friends, just as though these presents were so many Christmas
turkeys.

After all, I do not think that my remarks about religion made much
impression upon Queequeg.  Because, in the first place, he somehow
seemed dull of hearing on that important subject, unless considered
from his own point of view; and, in the second place, he did not more
than one third understand me, couch my ideas simply as I would; and,
finally, he no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true
religion than I did.  He looked at me with a sort of condescending
concern and compassion, as though he thought it a great pity that
such a sensible young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical
pagan piety.

At last we rose and dressed; and Queequeg, taking a prodigiously
hearty breakfast of chowders of all sorts, so that the landlady
should not make much profit by reason of his Ramadan, we sallied out
to board the Pequod, sauntering along, and picking our teeth with
halibut bones.



CHAPTER 18

His Mark.


As we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship,
Queequeg carrying his harpoon, Captain Peleg in his gruff voice
loudly hailed us from his wigwam, saying he had not suspected my
friend was a cannibal, and furthermore announcing that he let no
cannibals on board that craft, unless they previously produced their
papers.

What do you mean by that, Captain Peleg? said I, now jumping on the
bulwarks, and leaving my comrade standing on the wharf.

I mean, he replied, he must show his papers.

Yes, said Captain Bildad in his hollow voice, sticking his head
from behind Peleg's, out of the wigwam.  He must show that he's"
1770	converted.  Son of darkness, he added, turning to Queequeg, art
1771	"thou at present in communion with any Christian church?

Why, said I, he's a member of the first Congregational Church.
Here be it said, that many tattooed savages sailing in Nantucket
ships at last come to be converted into the churches.

First Congregational Church, cried Bildad, what! that worships in"
1772	"Deacon Deuteronomy Coleman's meeting-house? and so saying, taking
out his spectacles, he rubbed them with his great yellow bandana
handkerchief, and putting them on very carefully, came out of the
wigwam, and leaning stiffly over the bulwarks, took a good long look
at Queequeg.

How long hath he been a member? he then said, turning to me; not"
1773	"very long, I rather guess, young man.

No, said Peleg, and he hasn't been baptized right either, or it"
1774	"would have washed some of that devil's blue off his face.

Do tell, now, cried Bildad, is this Philistine a regular member of"
1775	Deacon Deuteronomy's meeting?  I never saw him going there, and I
1776	"pass it every Lord's day.

I don't know anything about Deacon Deuteronomy or his meeting, said
I; all I know is, that Queequeg here is a born member of the First"
1777	"Congregational Church.  He is a deacon himself, Queequeg is.

Young man, said Bildad sternly, thou art skylarking with"
1778	me--explain thyself, thou young Hittite.  What church dost thee mean?
1779	"answer me.

Finding myself thus hard pushed, I replied.  I mean, sir, the same"
1780	ancient Catholic Church to which you and I, and Captain Peleg there,
1781	and Queequeg here, and all of us, and every mother's son and soul of
1782	us belong; the great and everlasting First Congregation of this whole
1783	worshipping world; we all belong to that; only some of us cherish
1784	some queer crotchets no ways touching the grand belief; in THAT we
1785	"all join hands.

Splice, thou mean'st SPLICE hands, cried Peleg, drawing nearer.
Young man, you'd better ship for a missionary, instead of a"
1786	fore-mast hand; I never heard a better sermon.  Deacon
1787	Deuteronomy--why Father Mapple himself couldn't beat it, and he's
1788	reckoned something.  Come aboard, come aboard; never mind about the
1789	papers.  I say, tell Quohog there--what's that you call him? tell
1790	Quohog to step along.  By the great anchor, what a harpoon he's got
1791	there! looks like good stuff that; and he handles it about right.  I
1792	say, Quohog, or whatever your name is, did you ever stand in the head
1793	"of a whale-boat? did you ever strike a fish?

Without saying a word, Queequeg, in his wild sort of way, jumped upon
the bulwarks, from thence into the bows of one of the whale-boats
hanging to the side; and then bracing his left knee, and poising his
harpoon, cried out in some such way as this:--

Cap'ain, you see him small drop tar on water dere?  You see him?"
1794	"well, spose him one whale eye, well, den! and taking sharp aim at
it, he darted the iron right over old Bildad's broad brim, clean
across the ship's decks, and struck the glistening tar spot out of
sight.

Now, said Queequeg, quietly hauling in the line, spos-ee him"
1795	"whale-e eye; why, dad whale dead.

Quick, Bildad, said Peleg, his partner, who, aghast at the close
vicinity of the flying harpoon, had retreated towards the cabin
gangway.  Quick, I say, you Bildad, and get the ship's papers.  We"
1796	must have Hedgehog there, I mean Quohog, in one of our boats.  Look
1797	ye, Quohog, we'll give ye the ninetieth lay, and that's more than
1798	"ever was given a harpooneer yet out of Nantucket.

So down we went into the cabin, and to my great joy Queequeg was soon
enrolled among the same ship's company to which I myself belonged.

When all preliminaries were over and Peleg had got everything ready
for signing, he turned to me and said, I guess, Quohog there don't"
1799	know how to write, does he?  I say, Quohog, blast ye! dost thou sign
1800	thy name or make thy mark?
1801	
1802	But at this question, Queequeg, who had twice or thrice before taken
1803	part in similar ceremonies, looked no ways abashed; but taking the
1804	offered pen, copied upon the paper, in the proper place, an exact
1805	counterpart of a queer round figure which was tattooed upon his arm;
1806	so that through Captain Peleg's obstinate mistake touching his
1807	appellative, it stood something like this:--
1808	
1809	Quohog.
1810	his X mark.
1811	
1812	Meanwhile Captain Bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly eyeing
1813	Queequeg, and at last rising solemnly and fumbling in the huge
1814	pockets of his broad-skirted drab coat, took out a bundle of tracts,
1815	"and selecting one entitled The Latter Day Coming; or No Time to
Lose, placed it in Queequeg's hands, and then grasping them and the"
1816	"book with both his, looked earnestly into his eyes, and said, Son of
darkness, I must do my duty by thee; I am part owner of this ship,
and feel concerned for the souls of all its crew; if thou still
clingest to thy Pagan ways, which I sadly fear, I beseech thee,
remain not for aye a Belial bondsman.  Spurn the idol Bell, and the
hideous dragon; turn from the wrath to come; mind thine eye, I say;
oh! goodness gracious! steer clear of the fiery pit!"
1817	
1818	Something of the salt sea yet lingered in old Bildad's language,
1819	heterogeneously mixed with Scriptural and domestic phrases.
1820	
1821	"Avast there, avast there, Bildad, avast now spoiling our
harpooneer, Peleg.  Pious harpooneers never make good voyagers--it
takes the shark out of 'em; no harpooneer is worth a straw who aint
pretty sharkish.  There was young Nat Swaine, once the bravest
boat-header out of all Nantucket and the Vineyard; he joined the
meeting, and never came to good.  He got so frightened about his
plaguy soul, that he shrinked and sheered away from whales, for fear
of after-claps, in case he got stove and went to Davy Jones."
1822	
1823	"Peleg!  Peleg! said Bildad, lifting his eyes and hands, thou
thyself, as I myself, hast seen many a perilous time; thou knowest,
Peleg, what it is to have the fear of death; how, then, can'st thou
prate in this ungodly guise.  Thou beliest thine own heart, Peleg.
Tell me, when this same Pequod here had her three masts overboard in
that typhoon on Japan, that same voyage when thou went mate with
Captain Ahab, did'st thou not think of Death and the Judgment then?"
1824	
1825	Hear him, hear him now, cried Peleg, marching across the cabin, and
1826	"thrusting his hands far down into his pockets,--hear him, all of ye.
Think of that!  When every moment we thought the ship would sink!
Death and the Judgment then?  What?  With all three masts making such
an everlasting thundering against the side; and every sea breaking
over us, fore and aft.  Think of Death and the Judgment then?  No!
no time to think about Death then.  Life was what Captain Ahab and I
was thinking of; and how to save all hands--how to rig
jury-masts--how to get into the nearest port; that was what I was
thinking of."
1827	
1828	Bildad said no more, but buttoning up his coat, stalked on deck,
1829	where we followed him.  There he stood, very quietly overlooking some
1830	sailmakers who were mending a top-sail in the waist.  Now and then he
1831	stooped to pick up a patch, or save an end of tarred twine, which
1832	otherwise might have been wasted.

1836	CHAPTER 19
1837	
1838	The Prophet.
1839	
1840	
1841	Shipmates, have ye shipped in that ship?
1842	
1843	Queequeg and I had just left the Pequod, and were sauntering away from
1844	the water, for the moment each occupied with his own thoughts, when
1845	the above words were put to us by a stranger, who, pausing before us,
1846	levelled his massive forefinger at the vessel in question.  He was
1847	but shabbily apparelled in faded jacket and patched trowsers; a rag
1848	of a black handkerchief investing his neck.  A confluent small-pox
1849	had in all directions flowed over his face, and left it like the
1850	complicated ribbed bed of a torrent, when the rushing waters have
1851	been dried up.
1852	
1853	Have ye shipped in her? he repeated.
1854	
1855	You mean the ship Pequod, I suppose, said I, trying to gain a
1856	little more time for an uninterrupted look at him.
1857	
1858	Aye, the Pequod--that ship there, he said, drawing back his whole
1859	arm, and then rapidly shoving it straight out from him, with the
1860	fixed bayonet of his pointed finger darted full at the object.
1861	
1862	Yes, said I, we have just signed the articles.
1863	
1864	Anything down there about your souls?
1865	
1866	About what?
1867	
1868	"Oh, perhaps you hav'n't got any, he said quickly.  No matter
though, I know many chaps that hav'n't got any,--good luck to 'em;
and they are all the better off for it.  A soul's a sort of a fifth
wheel to a wagon."
1869	
1870	What are you jabbering about, shipmate? said I.
1871	
1872	"HE'S got enough, though, to make up for all deficiencies of that
sort in other chaps, abruptly said the stranger, placing a nervous"
1873	emphasis upon the word HE.
1874	
1875	"Queequeg, said I, let's go; this fellow has broken loose from
somewhere; he's talking about something and somebody we don't know."
1876	
1877	"Stop! cried the stranger.  Ye said true--ye hav'n't seen Old
Thunder yet, have ye?"
1878	
1879	Who's Old Thunder? said I, again riveted with the insane
1880	earnestness of his manner.
1881	
1882	Captain Ahab.
1883	
1884	What! the captain of our ship, the Pequod?
1885	
1886	"Aye, among some of us old sailor chaps, he goes by that name.  Ye
hav'n't seen him yet, have ye?"
1887	
1888	"No, we hav'n't.  He's sick they say, but is getting better, and will
be all right again before long."
1889	
1890	All right again before long! laughed the stranger, with a solemnly
1891	"derisive sort of laugh.  Look ye; when Captain Ahab is all right,
then this left arm of mine will be all right; not before."
1892	
1893	What do you know about him?
1894	
1895	What did they TELL you about him?  Say that!
1896	
1897	"They didn't tell much of anything about him; only I've heard that
he's a good whale-hunter, and a good captain to his crew."
1898	
1899	"That's true, that's true--yes, both true enough.  But you must jump
when he gives an order.  Step and growl; growl and go--that's the
word with Captain Ahab.  But nothing about that thing that happened
to him off Cape Horn, long ago, when he lay like dead for three days
and nights; nothing about that deadly skrimmage with the Spaniard
afore the altar in Santa?--heard nothing about that, eh?  Nothing
about the silver calabash he spat into?  And nothing about his losing
his leg last voyage, according to the prophecy.  Didn't ye hear a
word about them matters and something more, eh?  No, I don't think ye
did; how could ye?  Who knows it?  Not all Nantucket, I guess.  But
hows'ever, mayhap, ye've heard tell about the leg, and how he lost
it; aye, ye have heard of that, I dare say.  Oh yes, THAT every one
knows a'most--I mean they know he's only one leg; and that a
parmacetti took the other off."
1900	
1901	"My friend, said I, what all this gibberish of yours is about, I
don't know, and I don't much care; for it seems to me that you must
be a little damaged in the head.  But if you are speaking of Captain
Ahab, of that ship there, the Pequod, then let me tell you, that I
know all about the loss of his leg."
1902	
1903	ALL about it, eh--sure you do?--all?
1904	
1905	Pretty sure.
1906	
1907	With finger pointed and eye levelled at the Pequod, the beggar-like
1908	stranger stood a moment, as if in a troubled reverie; then starting a
1909	"little, turned and said:--Ye've shipped, have ye?  Names down on the
papers?  Well, well, what's signed, is signed; and what's to be, will
be; and then again, perhaps it won't be, after all.  Anyhow, it's
all fixed and arranged a'ready; and some sailors or other must go
with him, I suppose; as well these as any other men, God pity 'em!
Morning to ye, shipmates, morning; the ineffable heavens bless ye;
I'm sorry I stopped ye."
1910	
1911	"Look here, friend, said I, if you have anything important to tell
us, out with it; but if you are only trying to bamboozle us, you are
mistaken in your game; that's all I have to say."
1912	
1913	"And it's said very well, and I like to hear a chap talk up that way;
you are just the man for him--the likes of ye.  Morning to ye,
shipmates, morning!  Oh! when ye get there, tell 'em I've concluded
not to make one of 'em."
1914	
1915	"Ah, my dear fellow, you can't fool us that way--you can't fool us.
It is the easiest thing in the world for a man to look as if he had a
great secret in him."
1916	
1917	Morning to ye, shipmates, morning.
1918	
1919	"Morning it is, said I.  Come along, Queequeg, let's leave this
crazy man.  But stop, tell me your name, will you?"
1920	
1921	Elijah.
1922	
1923	Elijah! thought I, and we walked away, both commenting, after each
1924	other's fashion, upon this ragged old sailor; and agreed that he was
1925	nothing but a humbug, trying to be a bugbear.  But we had not gone
1926	perhaps above a hundred yards, when chancing to turn a corner, and
1927	looking back as I did so, who should be seen but Elijah following us,
1928	though at a distance.  Somehow, the sight of him struck me so, that I
1929	said nothing to Queequeg of his being behind, but passed on with my
1930	comrade, anxious to see whether the stranger would turn the same
1931	corner that we did.  He did; and then it seemed to me that he was
1932	dogging us, but with what intent I could not for the life of me
1933	imagine.  This circumstance, coupled with his ambiguous,
1934	half-hinting, half-revealing, shrouded sort of talk, now begat in me
1935	all kinds of vague wonderments and half-apprehensions, and all
1936	connected with the Pequod; and Captain Ahab; and the leg he had lost;
1937	and the Cape Horn fit; and the silver calabash; and what Captain
1938	Peleg had said of him, when I left the ship the day previous; and the
1939	prediction of the squaw Tistig; and the voyage we had bound ourselves
1940	to sail; and a hundred other shadowy things.
1941	
1942	I was resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged Elijah was
1943	really dogging us or not, and with that intent crossed the way with
1944	Queequeg, and on that side of it retraced our steps.  But Elijah
1945	passed on, without seeming to notice us.  This relieved me; and once
1946	more, and finally as it seemed to me, I pronounced him in my heart, a
1947	humbug.
1948	
1949	
1950	
1951	CHAPTER 20
1952	
1953	All Astir.
1954	
1955	
1956	A day or two passed, and there was great activity aboard the Pequod.
1957	Not only were the old sails being mended, but new sails were coming
1958	on board, and bolts of canvas, and coils of rigging; in short,
1959	everything betokened that the ship's preparations were hurrying to a
1960	close.  Captain Peleg seldom or never went ashore, but sat in his
1961	wigwam keeping a sharp look-out upon the hands: Bildad did all the
1962	purchasing and providing at the stores; and the men employed in the
1963	hold and on the rigging were working till long after night-fall.
1964	
1965	On the day following Queequeg's signing the articles, word was given
1966	at all the inns where the ship's company were stopping, that their
1967	chests must be on board before night, for there was no telling how
1968	soon the vessel might be sailing.  So Queequeg and I got down our
1969	traps, resolving, however, to sleep ashore till the last.  But it
1970	seems they always give very long notice in these cases, and the ship
1971	did not sail for several days.  But no wonder; there was a good deal
1972	to be done, and there is no telling how many things to be thought of,
1973	before the Pequod was fully equipped.
1974	
1975	Every one knows what a multitude of things--beds, sauce-pans, knives
1976	and forks, shovels and tongs, napkins, nut-crackers, and what not,
1977	are indispensable to the business of housekeeping.  Just so with
1978	whaling, which necessitates a three-years' housekeeping upon the wide
1979	ocean, far from all grocers, costermongers, doctors, bakers, and
1980	bankers.  And though this also holds true of merchant vessels, yet
1981	not by any means to the same extent as with whalemen.  For besides
1982	the great length of the whaling voyage, the numerous articles
1983	peculiar to the prosecution of the fishery, and the impossibility of
1984	replacing them at the remote harbors usually frequented, it must be
1985	remembered, that of all ships, whaling vessels are the most exposed
1986	to accidents of all kinds, and especially to the destruction and loss
1987	of the very things upon which the success of the voyage most depends.
1988	Hence, the spare boats, spare spars, and spare lines and harpoons,
1989	and spare everythings, almost, but a spare Captain and duplicate
1990	ship.
1991	
1992	At the period of our arrival at the Island, the heaviest storage of
1993	the Pequod had been almost completed; comprising her beef, bread,
1994	water, fuel, and iron hoops and staves.  But, as before hinted, for
1995	some time there was a continual fetching and carrying on board of
1996	divers odds and ends of things, both large and small.
1997	
1998	Chief among those who did this fetching and carrying was Captain
1999	Bildad's sister, a lean old lady of a most determined and
2000	indefatigable spirit, but withal very kindhearted, who seemed
2001	resolved that, if SHE could help it, nothing should be found wanting
2002	in the Pequod, after once fairly getting to sea.  At one time she
2003	would come on board with a jar of pickles for the steward's pantry;
2004	another time with a bunch of quills for the chief mate's desk, where
2005	he kept his log; a third time with a roll of flannel for the small of
2006	some one's rheumatic back.  Never did any woman better deserve her
2007	name, which was Charity--Aunt Charity, as everybody called her.  And
2008	like a sister of charity did this charitable Aunt Charity bustle
2009	about hither and thither, ready to turn her hand and heart to
2010	anything that promised to yield safety, comfort, and consolation to
2011	all on board a ship in which her beloved brother Bildad was
2012	concerned, and in which she herself owned a score or two of
2013	well-saved dollars.
2014	
2015	But it was startling to see this excellent hearted Quakeress coming
2016	on board, as she did the last day, with a long oil-ladle in one hand,
2017	and a still longer whaling lance in the other.  Nor was Bildad himself
2018	nor Captain Peleg at all backward.  As for Bildad, he carried about
2019	with him a long list of the articles needed, and at every fresh
2020	arrival, down went his mark opposite that article upon the paper.
2021	Every once in a while Peleg came hobbling out of his whalebone den,
2022	roaring at the men down the hatchways, roaring up to the riggers at
2023	the mast-head, and then concluded by roaring back into his wigwam.
2024	
2025	During these days of preparation, Queequeg and I often visited the
2026	craft, and as often I asked about Captain Ahab, and how he was, and
2027	when he was going to come on board his ship.  To these questions they
2028	would answer, that he was getting better and better, and was expected
2029	aboard every day; meantime, the two captains, Peleg and Bildad, could
2030	attend to everything necessary to fit the vessel for the voyage.  If
2031	I had been downright honest with myself, I would have seen very
2032	plainly in my heart that I did but half fancy being committed this
2033	way to so long a voyage, without once laying my eyes on the man who
2034	was to be the absolute dictator of it, so soon as the ship sailed out
2035	upon the open sea.  But when a man suspects any wrong, it sometimes
2036	happens that if he be already involved in the matter, he insensibly
2037	strives to cover up his suspicions even from himself.  And much this
2038	way it was with me.  I said nothing, and tried to think nothing.
2039	
2040	At last it was given out that some time next day the ship would
2041	certainly sail.  So next morning, Queequeg and I took a very early
2042	start.
2043	
2044	
2045	
2046	CHAPTER 21
2047	
2048	Going Aboard.
2049	
2050	
2051	It was nearly six o'clock, but only grey imperfect misty dawn, when
2052	we drew nigh the wharf.
2053	
2054	There are some sailors running ahead there, if I see right, said I
2055	"to Queequeg, it can't be shadows; she's off by sunrise, I guess;
come on!"
2056	
2057	Avast! cried a voice, whose owner at the same time coming close
2058	behind us, laid a hand upon both our shoulders, and then insinuating
2059	himself between us, stood stooping forward a little, in the uncertain
2060	twilight, strangely peering from Queequeg to me.  It was Elijah.
2061	
2062	Going aboard?
2063	
2064	Hands off, will you, said I.
2065	
2066	Lookee here, said Queequeg, shaking himself, go 'way!
2067	
2068	Ain't going aboard, then?
2069	
2070	"Yes, we are, said I, but what business is that of yours?  Do you
know, Mr. Elijah, that I consider you a little impertinent?"
2071	
2072	No, no, no; I wasn't aware of that, said Elijah, slowly and
2073	wonderingly looking from me to Queequeg, with the most unaccountable
2074	glances.
2075	
2076	"Elijah, said I, you will oblige my friend and me by withdrawing.
We are going to the Indian and Pacific Oceans, and would prefer not
to be detained."
2077	
2078	Ye be, be ye?  Coming back afore breakfast?
2079	
2080	He's cracked, Queequeg, said I, come on.
2081	
2082	Holloa! cried stationary Elijah, hailing us when we had removed a
2083	few paces.
2084	
2085	Never mind him, said I, Queequeg, come on.
2086	
2087	But he stole up to us again, and suddenly clapping his hand on my
2088	"shoulder, said--Did ye see anything looking like men going towards
that ship a while ago?"
2089	
2090	Struck by this plain matter-of-fact question, I answered, saying,
2091	"Yes, I thought I did see four or five men; but it was too dim to be
sure."
2092	
2093	Very dim, very dim, said Elijah.  Morning to ye.
2094	
2095	Once more we quitted him; but once more he came softly after us; and
2096	"touching my shoulder again, said, See if you can find 'em now, will
ye?

Find who?

Morning to ye! morning to ye! he rejoined, again moving off.  Oh!"
2097	I was going to warn ye against--but never mind, never mind--it's all
2098	one, all in the family too;--sharp frost this morning, ain't it?
2099	Good-bye to ye.  Shan't see ye again very soon, I guess; unless it's
2100	"before the Grand Jury.  And with these cracked words he finally
departed, leaving me, for the moment, in no small wonderment at his
frantic impudence.

At last, stepping on board the Pequod, we found everything in
profound quiet, not a soul moving.  The cabin entrance was locked
within; the hatches were all on, and lumbered with coils of rigging.
Going forward to the forecastle, we found the slide of the scuttle
open.  Seeing a light, we went down, and found only an old rigger
there, wrapped in a tattered pea-jacket.  He was thrown at whole
length upon two chests, his face downwards and inclosed in his folded
arms.  The profoundest slumber slept upon him.

Those sailors we saw, Queequeg, where can they have gone to? said
I, looking dubiously at the sleeper.  But it seemed that, when on the
wharf, Queequeg had not at all noticed what I now alluded to; hence I
would have thought myself to have been optically deceived in that
matter, were it not for Elijah's otherwise inexplicable question.
But I beat the thing down; and again marking the sleeper, jocularly
hinted to Queequeg that perhaps we had best sit up with the body;
telling him to establish himself accordingly.  He put his hand upon
the sleeper's rear, as though feeling if it was soft enough; and
then, without more ado, sat quietly down there.

Gracious!  Queequeg, don't sit there, said I.

Oh! perry dood seat, said Queequeg, my country way; won't hurt"
2101	"him face.

Face! said I, call that his face? very benevolent countenance"
2102	then; but how hard he breathes, he's heaving himself; get off,
2103	Queequeg, you are heavy, it's grinding the face of the poor.  Get
2104	off, Queequeg!  Look, he'll twitch you off soon.  I wonder he don't
2105	"wake.

Queequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper, and
lighted his tomahawk pipe.  I sat at the feet.  We kept the pipe
passing over the sleeper, from one to the other.  Meanwhile, upon
questioning him in his broken fashion, Queequeg gave me to understand
that, in his land, owing to the absence of settees and sofas of all
sorts, the king, chiefs, and great people generally, were in the
custom of fattening some of the lower orders for ottomans; and to
furnish a house comfortably in that respect, you had only to buy up
eight or ten lazy fellows, and lay them round in the piers and
alcoves.  Besides, it was very convenient on an excursion; much
better than those garden-chairs which are convertible into
walking-sticks; upon occasion, a chief calling his attendant, and
desiring him to make a settee of himself under a spreading tree,
perhaps in some damp marshy place.

While narrating these things, every time Queequeg received the
tomahawk from me, he flourished the hatchet-side of it over the
sleeper's head.

What's that for, Queequeg?

Perry easy, kill-e; oh! perry easy!"
2106	
2107	He was going on with some wild reminiscences about his tomahawk-pipe,
2108	which, it seemed, had in its two uses both brained his foes and
2109	soothed his soul, when we were directly attracted to the sleeping
2110	rigger.  The strong vapour now completely filling the contracted hole,
2111	it began to tell upon him.  He breathed with a sort of muffledness;
2112	then seemed troubled in the nose; then revolved over once or twice;
2113	then sat up and rubbed his eyes.
2114	
2115	Holloa! he breathed at last, who be ye smokers?
2116	
2117	Shipped men, answered I, when does she sail?
2118	
2119	"Aye, aye, ye are going in her, be ye?  She sails to-day.  The
Captain came aboard last night."
2120	
2121	What Captain?--Ahab?
2122	
2123	Who but him indeed?
2124	
2125	I was going to ask him some further questions concerning Ahab, when
2126	we heard a noise on deck.
2127	
2128	"Holloa!  Starbuck's astir, said the rigger.  He's a lively chief
mate, that; good man, and a pious; but all alive now, I must turn
to.  And so saying he went on deck, and we followed."
2129	
2130	It was now clear sunrise.  Soon the crew came on board in twos and
2131	threes; the riggers bestirred themselves; the mates were actively
2132	engaged; and several of the shore people were busy in bringing
2133	various last things on board.  Meanwhile Captain Ahab remained
2134	invisibly enshrined within his cabin.
2135	
2136	
2137	
2138	CHAPTER 22
2139	
2140	Merry Christmas.
2141	
2142	
2143	At length, towards noon, upon the final dismissal of the ship's
2144	riggers, and after the Pequod had been hauled out from the wharf, and
2145	after the ever-thoughtful Charity had come off in a whale-boat, with
2146	her last gift--a night-cap for Stubb, the second mate, her
2147	brother-in-law, and a spare Bible for the steward--after all this,
2148	the two Captains, Peleg and Bildad, issued from the cabin, and
2149	turning to the chief mate, Peleg said:
2150	
2151	"Now, Mr. Starbuck, are you sure everything is right?  Captain Ahab
is all ready--just spoke to him--nothing more to be got from shore,
eh?  Well, call all hands, then.  Muster 'em aft here--blast 'em!"
2152	
2153	No need of profane words, however great the hurry, Peleg, said
2154	Bildad, but away with thee, friend Starbuck, and do our bidding.
2155	
2156	How now!  Here upon the very point of starting for the voyage,
2157	Captain Peleg and Captain Bildad were going it with a high hand on
2158	the quarter-deck, just as if they were to be joint-commanders at sea,
2159	as well as to all appearances in port.  And, as for Captain Ahab, no
2160	sign of him was yet to be seen; only, they said he was in the cabin.
2161	But then, the idea was, that his presence was by no means necessary
2162	in getting the ship under weigh, and steering her well out to sea.
2163	Indeed, as that was not at all his proper business, but the pilot's;
2164	and as he was not yet completely recovered--so they said--therefore,
2165	Captain Ahab stayed below.  And all this seemed natural enough;
2166	especially as in the merchant service many captains never show
2167	themselves on deck for a considerable time after heaving up the
2168	anchor, but remain over the cabin table, having a farewell
2169	merry-making with their shore friends, before they quit the ship for
2170	good with the pilot.
2171	
2172	But there was not much chance to think over the matter, for Captain
2173	Peleg was now all alive.  He seemed to do most of the talking and
2174	commanding, and not Bildad.
2175	
2176	Aft here, ye sons of bachelors, he cried, as the sailors lingered
2177	at the main-mast.  Mr. Starbuck, drive'em aft.
2178	
2179	Strike the tent there!--was the next order.  As I hinted before,
2180	this whalebone marquee was never pitched except in port; and on board
2181	the Pequod, for thirty years, the order to strike the tent was well
2182	known to be the next thing to heaving up the anchor.
2183	
2184	Man the capstan!  Blood and thunder!--jump!--was the next command,
2185	and the crew sprang for the handspikes.
2186	
2187	Now in getting under weigh, the station generally occupied by the
2188	pilot is the forward part of the ship.  And here Bildad, who, with
2189	Peleg, be it known, in addition to his other officers, was one of the
2190	licensed pilots of the port--he being suspected to have got himself
2191	made a pilot in order to save the Nantucket pilot-fee to all the
2192	ships he was concerned in, for he never piloted any other
2193	craft--Bildad, I say, might now be seen actively engaged in looking
2194	over the bows for the approaching anchor, and at intervals singing
2195	what seemed a dismal stave of psalmody, to cheer the hands at the
2196	windlass, who roared forth some sort of a chorus about the girls in
2197	Booble Alley, with hearty good will.  Nevertheless, not three days
2198	previous, Bildad had told them that no profane songs would be allowed
2199	on board the Pequod, particularly in getting under weigh; and
2200	Charity, his sister, had placed a small choice copy of Watts in each
2201	seaman's berth.
2202	
2203	Meantime, overseeing the other part of the ship, Captain Peleg ripped
2204	and swore astern in the most frightful manner.  I almost thought he
2205	would sink the ship before the anchor could be got up; involuntarily
2206	I paused on my handspike, and told Queequeg to do the same, thinking
2207	of the perils we both ran, in starting on the voyage with such a
2208	devil for a pilot.  I was comforting myself, however, with the
2209	thought that in pious Bildad might be found some salvation, spite of
2210	his seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay; when I felt a sudden sharp
2211	poke in my rear, and turning round, was horrified at the apparition
2212	of Captain Peleg in the act of withdrawing his leg from my immediate
2213	vicinity.  That was my first kick.
2214	
2215	Is that the way they heave in the marchant service? he roared.
2216	"Spring, thou sheep-head; spring, and break thy backbone!  Why don't
ye spring, I say, all of ye--spring!  Quohog! spring, thou chap with
the red whiskers; spring there, Scotch-cap; spring, thou green
pants.  Spring, I say, all of ye, and spring your eyes out!  And so"
2217	saying, he moved along the windlass, here and there using his leg
2218	very freely, while imperturbable Bildad kept leading off with his
2219	psalmody.  Thinks I, Captain Peleg must have been drinking something
2220	to-day.
2221	
2222	At last the anchor was up, the sails were set, and off we glided.  It
2223	was a short, cold Christmas; and as the short northern day merged
2224	into night, we found ourselves almost broad upon the wintry ocean,
2225	whose freezing spray cased us in ice, as in polished armor.  The long
2226	rows of teeth on the bulwarks glistened in the moonlight; and like
2227	the white ivory tusks of some huge elephant, vast curving icicles
2228	depended from the bows.
2229	
2230	Lank Bildad, as pilot, headed the first watch, and ever and anon, as
2231	the old craft deep dived into the green seas, and sent the shivering
2232	frost all over her, and the winds howled, and the cordage rang, his
2233	steady notes were heard,--
2234	
2235	"Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood,
Stand dressed in living green.
So to the Jews old Canaan stood,
While Jordan rolled between."
2236	
2237	
2238	Never did those sweet words sound more sweetly to me than then.  They
2239	were full of hope and fruition.  Spite of this frigid winter night in
2240	the boisterous Atlantic, spite of my wet feet and wetter jacket,
2241	there was yet, it then seemed to me, many a pleasant haven in store;
2242	and meads and glades so eternally vernal, that the grass shot up by
2243	the spring, untrodden, unwilted, remains at midsummer.
2244	
2245	At last we gained such an offing, that the two pilots were needed no
2246	longer.  The stout sail-boat that had accompanied us began ranging
2247	alongside.
2248	
2249	It was curious and not unpleasing, how Peleg and Bildad were affected
2250	at this juncture, especially Captain Bildad.  For loath to depart,
2251	yet; very loath to leave, for good, a ship bound on so long and
2252	perilous a voyage--beyond both stormy Capes; a ship in which some
2253	thousands of his hard earned dollars were invested; a ship, in which
2254	an old shipmate sailed as captain; a man almost as old as he, once
2255	more starting to encounter all the terrors of the pitiless jaw; loath
2256	to say good-bye to a thing so every way brimful of every interest to
2257	him,--poor old Bildad lingered long; paced the deck with anxious
2258	strides; ran down into the cabin to speak another farewell word
2259	there; again came on deck, and looked to windward; looked towards the
2260	wide and endless waters, only bounded by the far-off unseen Eastern
2261	Continents; looked towards the land; looked aloft; looked right and
2262	left; looked everywhere and nowhere; and at last, mechanically
2263	coiling a rope upon its pin, convulsively grasped stout Peleg by the
2264	hand, and holding up a lantern, for a moment stood gazing heroically
2265	"in his face, as much as to say, Nevertheless, friend Peleg, I can
stand it; yes, I can."
2266	
2267	As for Peleg himself, he took it more like a philosopher; but for all
2268	his philosophy, there was a tear twinkling in his eye, when the
2269	lantern came too near.  And he, too, did not a little run from cabin
2270	to deck--now a word below, and now a word with Starbuck, the chief
2271	mate.
2272	
2273	But, at last, he turned to his comrade, with a final sort of look
2274	"about him,--Captain Bildad--come, old shipmate, we must go.  Back
the main-yard there!  Boat ahoy!  Stand by to come close alongside,
now!  Careful, careful!--come, Bildad, boy--say your last.  Luck to
ye, Starbuck--luck to ye, Mr. Stubb--luck to ye, Mr. Flask--good-bye
and good luck to ye all--and this day three years I'll have a hot
supper smoking for ye in old Nantucket.  Hurrah and away!"
2275	
2276	God bless ye, and have ye in His holy keeping, men, murmured old
2277	"Bildad, almost incoherently.  I hope ye'll have fine weather now, so
that Captain Ahab may soon be moving among ye--a pleasant sun is all
he needs, and ye'll have plenty of them in the tropic voyage ye go.
Be careful in the hunt, ye mates.  Don't stave the boats needlessly,
ye harpooneers; good white cedar plank is raised full three per cent.
within the year.  Don't forget your prayers, either.  Mr. Starbuck,
mind that cooper don't waste the spare staves.  Oh! the sail-needles
are in the green locker!  Don't whale it too much a' Lord's days,
men; but don't miss a fair chance either, that's rejecting Heaven's
good gifts.  Have an eye to the molasses tierce, Mr. Stubb; it was a
little leaky, I thought.  If ye touch at the islands, Mr. Flask,
beware of fornication.  Good-bye, good-bye!  Don't keep that cheese
too long down in the hold, Mr. Starbuck; it'll spoil.  Be careful
with the butter--twenty cents the pound it was, and mind ye, if--"
2278	
2279	Come, come, Captain Bildad; stop palavering,--away! and with that,
2280	Peleg hurried him over the side, and both dropt into the boat.
2281	
2282	Ship and boat diverged; the cold, damp night breeze blew between; a
2283	screaming gull flew overhead; the two hulls wildly rolled; we gave
2284	three heavy-hearted cheers, and blindly plunged like fate into the
2285	lone Atlantic.

2289	CHAPTER 23
2290	
2291	The Lee Shore.
2292	
2293	
2294	Some chapters back, one Bulkington was spoken of, a tall, newlanded
2295	mariner, encountered in New Bedford at the inn.
2296	
2297	When on that shivering winter's night, the Pequod thrust her
2298	vindictive bows into the cold malicious waves, who should I see
2299	standing at her helm but Bulkington!  I looked with sympathetic awe
2300	and fearfulness upon the man, who in mid-winter just landed from a
2301	four years' dangerous voyage, could so unrestingly push off again for
2302	still another tempestuous term.  The land seemed scorching to his
2303	feet.  Wonderfullest things are ever the unmentionable; deep memories
2304	yield no epitaphs; this six-inch chapter is the stoneless grave of
2305	Bulkington.  Let me only say that it fared with him as with the
2306	storm-tossed ship, that miserably drives along the leeward land.  The
2307	port would fain give succor; the port is pitiful; in the port is
2308	safety, comfort, hearthstone, supper, warm blankets, friends, all
2309	that's kind to our mortalities.  But in that gale, the port, the
2310	land, is that ship's direst jeopardy; she must fly all hospitality;
2311	one touch of land, though it but graze the keel, would make her
2312	shudder through and through.  With all her might she crowds all sail
2313	off shore; in so doing, fights 'gainst the very winds that fain would
2314	blow her homeward; seeks all the lashed sea's landlessness again; for
2315	refuge's sake forlornly rushing into peril; her only friend her
2316	bitterest foe!
2317	
2318	Know ye now, Bulkington?  Glimpses do ye seem to see of that mortally
2319	intolerable truth; that all deep, earnest thinking is but the
2320	intrepid effort of the soul to keep the open independence of her sea;
2321	while the wildest winds of heaven and earth conspire to cast her on
2322	the treacherous, slavish shore?
2323	
2324	But as in landlessness alone resides highest truth, shoreless,
2325	indefinite as God--so, better is it to perish in that howling
2326	infinite, than be ingloriously dashed upon the lee, even if that were
2327	safety!  For worm-like, then, oh! who would craven crawl to land!
2328	Terrors of the terrible! is all this agony so vain?  Take heart, take
2329	heart, O Bulkington!  Bear thee grimly, demigod!  Up from the spray
2330	of thy ocean-perishing--straight up, leaps thy apotheosis!

2333	
2334	CHAPTER 24
2335	
2336	The Advocate.
2337	
2338	
2339	As Queequeg and I are now fairly embarked in this business of
2340	whaling; and as this business of whaling has somehow come to be
2341	regarded among landsmen as a rather unpoetical and disreputable
2342	pursuit; therefore, I am all anxiety to convince ye, ye landsmen, of
2343	the injustice hereby done to us hunters of whales.
2344	
2345	In the first place, it may be deemed almost superfluous to establish
2346	the fact, that among people at large, the business of whaling is not
2347	accounted on a level with what are called the liberal professions.
2348	If a stranger were introduced into any miscellaneous metropolitan
2349	society, it would but slightly advance the general opinion of his
2350	merits, were he presented to the company as a harpooneer, say; and if
2351	in emulation of the naval officers he should append the initials
2352	S.W.F. (Sperm Whale Fishery) to his visiting card, such a procedure
2353	would be deemed pre-eminently presuming and ridiculous.
2354	
2355	Doubtless one leading reason why the world declines honouring us
2356	whalemen, is this: they think that, at best, our vocation amounts to
2357	a butchering sort of business; and that when actively engaged
2358	therein, we are surrounded by all manner of defilements.  Butchers we
2359	are, that is true.  But butchers, also, and butchers of the bloodiest
2360	badge have been all Martial Commanders whom the world invariably
2361	delights to honour.  And as for the matter of the alleged
2362	uncleanliness of our business, ye shall soon be initiated into
2363	certain facts hitherto pretty generally unknown, and which, upon the
2364	whole, will triumphantly plant the sperm whale-ship at least among
2365	the cleanliest things of this tidy earth.  But even granting the
2366	charge in question to be true; what disordered slippery decks of a
2367	whale-ship are comparable to the unspeakable carrion of those
2368	battle-fields from which so many soldiers return to drink in all
2369	ladies' plaudits?  And if the idea of peril so much enhances the
2370	popular conceit of the soldier's profession; let me assure ye that
2371	many a veteran who has freely marched up to a battery, would quickly
2372	recoil at the apparition of the sperm whale's vast tail, fanning into
2373	eddies the air over his head.  For what are the comprehensible
2374	terrors of man compared with the interlinked terrors and wonders of
2375	God!
2376	
2377	But, though the world scouts at us whale hunters, yet does it
2378	unwittingly pay us the profoundest homage; yea, an all-abounding
2379	adoration! for almost all the tapers, lamps, and candles that burn
2380	round the globe, burn, as before so many shrines, to our glory!
2381	
2382	But look at this matter in other lights; weigh it in all sorts of
2383	scales; see what we whalemen are, and have been.
2384	
2385	Why did the Dutch in De Witt's time have admirals of their whaling
2386	fleets?  Why did Louis XVI. of France, at his own personal expense,
2387	fit out whaling ships from Dunkirk, and politely invite to that town
2388	some score or two of families from our own island of Nantucket?  Why
2389	did Britain between the years 1750 and 1788 pay to her whalemen in
2390	bounties upwards of L1,000,000?  And lastly, how comes it that we
2391	whalemen of America now outnumber all the rest of the banded whalemen
2392	in the world; sail a navy of upwards of seven hundred vessels; manned
2393	by eighteen thousand men; yearly consuming 4,000,000 of dollars; the
2394	ships worth, at the time of sailing, $20,000,000! and every year
2395	importing into our harbors a well reaped harvest of $7,000,000.  How
2396	comes all this, if there be not something puissant in whaling?
2397	
2398	But this is not the half; look again.
2399	
2400	I freely assert, that the cosmopolite philosopher cannot, for his
2401	life, point out one single peaceful influence, which within the last
2402	sixty years has operated more potentially upon the whole broad world,
2403	taken in one aggregate, than the high and mighty business of whaling.
2404	One way and another, it has begotten events so remarkable in
2405	themselves, and so continuously momentous in their sequential issues,
2406	that whaling may well be regarded as that Egyptian mother, who bore
2407	offspring themselves pregnant from her womb.  It would be a hopeless,
2408	endless task to catalogue all these things.  Let a handful suffice.
2409	For many years past the whale-ship has been the pioneer in ferreting
2410	out the remotest and least known parts of the earth.  She has
2411	explored seas and archipelagoes which had no chart, where no Cook or
2412	Vancouver had ever sailed.  If American and European men-of-war
2413	now peacefully ride in once savage harbors, let them fire salutes to
2414	the honour and glory of the whale-ship, which originally showed them
2415	the way, and first interpreted between them and the savages.  They
2416	may celebrate as they will the heroes of Exploring Expeditions, your
2417	Cooks, your Krusensterns; but I say that scores of anonymous
2418	Captains have sailed out of Nantucket, that were as great, and
2419	greater than your Cook and your Krusenstern.  For in their
2420	succourless empty-handedness, they, in the heathenish sharked waters,
2421	and by the beaches of unrecorded, javelin islands, battled with
2422	virgin wonders and terrors that Cook with all his marines and
2423	muskets would not willingly have dared.  All that is made such a
2424	flourish of in the old South Sea Voyages, those things were but the
2425	life-time commonplaces of our heroic Nantucketers.  Often,
2426	adventures which Vancouver dedicates three chapters to, these men
2427	accounted unworthy of being set down in the ship's common log.  Ah,
2428	the world!  Oh, the world!
2429	
2430	Until the whale fishery rounded Cape Horn, no commerce but colonial,
2431	scarcely any intercourse but colonial, was carried on between Europe
2432	and the long line of the opulent Spanish provinces on the Pacific
2433	coast.  It was the whaleman who first broke through the jealous
2434	policy of the Spanish crown, touching those colonies; and, if space
2435	permitted, it might be distinctly shown how from those whalemen at
2436	last eventuated the liberation of Peru, Chili, and Bolivia from the
2437	yoke of Old Spain, and the establishment of the eternal democracy in
2438	those parts.
2439	
2440	That great America on the other side of the sphere, Australia, was
2441	given to the enlightened world by the whaleman.  After its first
2442	blunder-born discovery by a Dutchman, all other ships long shunned
2443	those shores as pestiferously barbarous; but the whale-ship touched
2444	there.  The whale-ship is the true mother of that now mighty colony.
2445	Moreover, in the infancy of the first Australian settlement, the
2446	emigrants were several times saved from starvation by the benevolent
2447	biscuit of the whale-ship luckily dropping an anchor in their waters.
2448	The uncounted isles of all Polynesia confess the same truth, and do
2449	commercial homage to the whale-ship, that cleared the way for the
2450	missionary and the merchant, and in many cases carried the primitive
2451	missionaries to their first destinations.  If that double-bolted
2452	land, Japan, is ever to become hospitable, it is the whale-ship alone
2453	to whom the credit will be due; for already she is on the threshold.
2454	
2455	But if, in the face of all this, you still declare that whaling has
2456	no aesthetically noble associations connected with it, then am I
2457	ready to shiver fifty lances with you there, and unhorse you with a
2458	split helmet every time.
2459	
2460	The whale has no famous author, and whaling no famous chronicler, you
2461	will say.
2462	
2463	THE WHALE NO FAMOUS AUTHOR, AND WHALING NO FAMOUS CHRONICLER?  Who
2464	wrote the first account of our Leviathan?  Who but mighty Job!  And
2465	who composed the first narrative of a whaling-voyage?  Who, but no
2466	less a prince than Alfred the Great, who, with his own royal pen,
2467	took down the words from Other, the Norwegian whale-hunter of those
2468	times!  And who pronounced our glowing eulogy in Parliament?  Who,
2469	but Edmund Burke!
2470	
2471	True enough, but then whalemen themselves are poor devils; they have
2472	no good blood in their veins.
2473	
2474	NO GOOD BLOOD IN THEIR VEINS?  They have something better than royal
2475	blood there.  The grandmother of Benjamin Franklin was Mary Morrel;
2476	afterwards, by marriage, Mary Folger, one of the old settlers of
2477	Nantucket, and the ancestress to a long line of Folgers and
2478	harpooneers--all kith and kin to noble Benjamin--this day darting the
2479	barbed iron from one side of the world to the other.
2480	
2481	Good again; but then all confess that somehow whaling is not
2482	respectable.
2483	
2484	WHALING NOT RESPECTABLE?  Whaling is imperial!  By old English
2485	statutory law, the whale is declared a royal fish.*
2486	
2487	Oh, that's only nominal!  The whale himself has never figured in any
2488	grand imposing way.
2489	
2490	THE WHALE NEVER FIGURED IN ANY GRAND IMPOSING WAY?  In one of the
2491	mighty triumphs given to a Roman general upon his entering the
2492	world's capital, the bones of a whale, brought all the way from the
2493	Syrian coast, were the most conspicuous object in the cymballed
2494	procession.*
2495	
2496	
2497	*See subsequent chapters for something more on this head.
2498	
2499	
2500	Grant it, since you cite it; but, say what you will, there is no real
2501	dignity in whaling.
2502	
2503	NO DIGNITY IN WHALING?  The dignity of our calling the very heavens
2504	attest.  Cetus is a constellation in the South!  No more!  Drive
2505	down your hat in presence of the Czar, and take it off to Queequeg!
2506	No more!  I know a man that, in his lifetime, has taken three hundred
2507	and fifty whales.  I account that man more honourable than that great
2508	captain of antiquity who boasted of taking as many walled towns.
2509	
2510	And, as for me, if, by any possibility, there be any as yet
2511	undiscovered prime thing in me; if I shall ever deserve any real
2512	repute in that small but high hushed world which I might not be
2513	unreasonably ambitious of; if hereafter I shall do anything that, upon
2514	the whole, a man might rather have done than to have left undone; if,
2515	at my death, my executors, or more properly my creditors, find any
2516	precious MSS. in my desk, then here I prospectively ascribe all the
2517	honour and the glory to whaling; for a whale-ship was my Yale College
2518	and my Harvard.
2519	
2520	
2521	
2522	CHAPTER 25
2523	
2524	Postscript.
2525	
2526	
2527	In behalf of the dignity of whaling, I would fain advance naught but
2528	substantiated facts.  But after embattling his facts, an advocate who
2529	should wholly suppress a not unreasonable surmise, which might tell
2530	eloquently upon his cause--such an advocate, would he not be
2531	blameworthy?
2532	
2533	It is well known that at the coronation of kings and queens, even
2534	modern ones, a certain curious process of seasoning them for their
2535	functions is gone through.  There is a saltcellar of state, so
2536	called, and there may be a castor of state.  How they use the salt,
2537	precisely--who knows?  Certain I am, however, that a king's head is
2538	solemnly oiled at his coronation, even as a head of salad.  Can it
2539	be, though, that they anoint it with a view of making its interior
2540	run well, as they anoint machinery?  Much might be ruminated here,
2541	concerning the essential dignity of this regal process, because in
2542	common life we esteem but meanly and contemptibly a fellow who
2543	anoints his hair, and palpably smells of that anointing.  In truth, a
2544	mature man who uses hair-oil, unless medicinally, that man has
2545	probably got a quoggy spot in him somewhere.  As a general rule, he
2546	can't amount to much in his totality.
2547	
2548	But the only thing to be considered here, is this--what kind of oil
2549	is used at coronations?  Certainly it cannot be olive oil, nor
2550	macassar oil, nor castor oil, nor bear's oil, nor train oil, nor
2551	cod-liver oil.  What then can it possibly be, but sperm oil in

2562	
2563	
2564	The chief mate of the Pequod was Starbuck, a native of Nantucket, and
2565	a Quaker by descent.  He was a long, earnest man, and though born on
2566	an icy coast, seemed well adapted to endure hot latitudes, his flesh
2567	being hard as twice-baked biscuit.  Transported to the Indies, his
2568	live blood would not spoil like bottled ale.  He must have been born
2569	in some time of general drought and famine, or upon one of those fast
2570	days for which his state is famous.  Only some thirty arid summers
2571	had he seen; those summers had dried up all his physical
2572	superfluousness.  But this, his thinness, so to speak, seemed no more
2573	the token of wasting anxieties and cares, than it seemed the
2574	indication of any bodily blight.  It was merely the condensation of
2575	the man.  He was by no means ill-looking; quite the contrary.  His
2576	pure tight skin was an excellent fit; and closely wrapped up in it,
2577	and embalmed with inner health and strength, like a revivified
2578	Egyptian, this Starbuck seemed prepared to endure for long ages to
2579	come, and to endure always, as now; for be it Polar snow or torrid
2580	sun, like a patent chronometer, his interior vitality was warranted
2581	to do well in all climates.  Looking into his eyes, you seemed to
2582	see there the yet lingering images of those thousand-fold perils he
2583	had calmly confronted through life.  A staid, steadfast man, whose
2584	life for the most part was a telling pantomime of action, and not a
2585	tame chapter of sounds.  Yet, for all his hardy sobriety and
2586	fortitude, there were certain qualities in him which at times
2587	affected, and in some cases seemed well nigh to overbalance all the
2588	rest.  Uncommonly conscientious for a seaman, and endued with a deep
2589	natural reverence, the wild watery loneliness of his life did
2590	therefore strongly incline him to superstition; but to that sort of
2591	superstition, which in some organizations seems rather to spring,
2592	somehow, from intelligence than from ignorance.  Outward portents and
2593	inward presentiments were his.  And if at times these things bent the
2594	welded iron of his soul, much more did his far-away domestic memories
2595	of his young Cape wife and child, tend to bend him still more from
2596	the original ruggedness of his nature, and open him still further to
2597	those latent influences which, in some honest-hearted men, restrain
2598	the gush of dare-devil daring, so often evinced by others in the more
2599	"perilous vicissitudes of the fishery.  I will have no man in my
boat, said Starbuck, who is not afraid of a whale.  By this, he"
2600	seemed to mean, not only that the most reliable and useful courage
2601	was that which arises from the fair estimation of the encountered
2602	peril, but that an utterly fearless man is a far more dangerous
2603	comrade than a coward.
2604	
2605	"Aye, aye, said Stubb, the second mate, Starbuck, there, is as
careful a man as you'll find anywhere in this fishery.  But we shall"
2606	ere long see what that word careful precisely means when used by a
2607	man like Stubb, or almost any other whale hunter.
2608	
2609	Starbuck was no crusader after perils; in him courage was not a
2610	sentiment; but a thing simply useful to him, and always at hand upon
2611	all mortally practical occasions.  Besides, he thought, perhaps, that
2612	in this business of whaling, courage was one of the great staple
2613	outfits of the ship, like her beef and her bread, and not to be
2614	foolishly wasted.  Wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales
2615	after sun-down; nor for persisting in fighting a fish that too much
2616	persisted in fighting him.  For, thought Starbuck, I am here in this
2617	critical ocean to kill whales for my living, and not to be killed by
2618	them for theirs; and that hundreds of men had been so killed Starbuck
2619	well knew.  What doom was his own father's?  Where, in the bottomless
2620	deeps, could he find the torn limbs of his brother?
2621	
2622	With memories like these in him, and, moreover, given to a certain
2623	superstitiousness, as has been said; the courage of this Starbuck
2624	which could, nevertheless, still flourish, must indeed have been
2625	extreme.  But it was not in reasonable nature that a man so
2626	organized, and with such terrible experiences and remembrances as he
2627	had; it was not in nature that these things should fail in latently
2628	engendering an element in him, which, under suitable circumstances,
2629	would break out from its confinement, and burn all his courage up.
2630	And brave as he might be, it was that sort of bravery chiefly,
2631	visible in some intrepid men, which, while generally abiding firm in
2632	the conflict with seas, or winds, or whales, or any of the ordinary
2633	irrational horrors of the world, yet cannot withstand those more
2634	terrific, because more spiritual terrors, which sometimes menace you
2635	from the concentrating brow of an enraged and mighty man.
2636	
2637	But were the coming narrative to reveal in any instance, the complete
2638	abasement of poor Starbuck's fortitude, scarce might I have the heart
2639	to write it; for it is a thing most sorrowful, nay shocking, to
2640	expose the fall of valour in the soul.  Men may seem detestable as
2641	joint stock-companies and nations; knaves, fools, and murderers there
2642	may be; men may have mean and meagre faces; but man, in the ideal,
2643	is so noble and so sparkling, such a grand and glowing creature, that
2644	over any ignominious blemish in him all his fellows should run to
2645	throw their costliest robes.  That immaculate manliness we feel
2646	within ourselves, so far within us, that it remains intact though all
2647	the outer character seem gone; bleeds with keenest anguish at the
2648	undraped spectacle of a valor-ruined man.  Nor can piety itself, at
2649	such a shameful sight, completely stifle her upbraidings against the
2650	permitting stars.  But this august dignity I treat of, is not the
2651	dignity of kings and robes, but that abounding dignity which has no
2652	robed investiture.  Thou shalt see it shining in the arm that wields
2653	a pick or drives a spike; that democratic dignity which, on all
2654	hands, radiates without end from God; Himself!  The great God
2655	absolute!  The centre and circumference of all democracy!  His
2656	omnipresence, our divine equality!
2657	
2658	If, then, to meanest mariners, and renegades and castaways, I shall
2659	hereafter ascribe high qualities, though dark; weave round them
2660	tragic graces; if even the most mournful, perchance the most abased,
2661	among them all, shall at times lift himself to the exalted mounts; if
2662	I shall touch that workman's arm with some ethereal light; if I shall
2663	spread a rainbow over his disastrous set of sun; then against all
2664	mortal critics bear me out in it, thou Just Spirit of Equality,
2665	which hast spread one royal mantle of humanity over all my kind!
2666	Bear me out in it, thou great democratic God! who didst not refuse to
2667	the swart convict, Bunyan, the pale, poetic pearl; Thou who didst
2668	clothe with doubly hammered leaves of finest gold, the stumped and
2669	paupered arm of old Cervantes; Thou who didst pick up Andrew Jackson
2670	from the pebbles; who didst hurl him upon a war-horse; who didst
2671	thunder him higher than a throne!  Thou who, in all Thy mighty,
2672	earthly marchings, ever cullest Thy selectest champions from the
2673	kingly commons; bear me out in it, O God!

2680	
2681	
2682	Stubb was the second mate.  He was a native of Cape Cod; and hence,
2683	according to local usage, was called a Cape-Cod-man.  A
2684	happy-go-lucky; neither craven nor valiant; taking perils as they
2685	came with an indifferent air; and while engaged in the most imminent
2686	crisis of the chase, toiling away, calm and collected as a journeyman
2687	joiner engaged for the year.  Good-humored, easy, and careless, he
2688	presided over his whale-boat as if the most deadly encounter were but
2689	a dinner, and his crew all invited guests.  He was as particular
2690	about the comfortable arrangement of his part of the boat, as an
2691	old stage-driver is about the snugness of his box.  When close to the
2692	whale, in the very death-lock of the fight, he handled his unpitying
2693	lance coolly and off-handedly, as a whistling tinker his hammer.  He
2694	would hum over his old rigadig tunes while flank and flank with the
2695	most exasperated monster.  Long usage had, for this Stubb, converted
2696	the jaws of death into an easy chair.  What he thought of death
2697	itself, there is no telling.  Whether he ever thought of it at all,
2698	might be a question; but, if he ever did chance to cast his mind that
2699	way after a comfortable dinner, no doubt, like a good sailor, he took
2700	it to be a sort of call of the watch to tumble aloft, and bestir
2701	themselves there, about something which he would find out when he
2702	obeyed the order, and not sooner.
2703	
2704	What, perhaps, with other things, made Stubb such an easy-going,
2705	unfearing man, so cheerily trudging off with the burden of life in a
2706	world full of grave pedlars, all bowed to the ground with their
2707	packs; what helped to bring about that almost impious good-humor of
2708	his; that thing must have been his pipe.  For, like his nose, his
2709	short, black little pipe was one of the regular features of his face.
2710	You would almost as soon have expected him to turn out of his bunk
2711	without his nose as without his pipe.  He kept a whole row of pipes
2712	there ready loaded, stuck in a rack, within easy reach of his hand;
2713	and, whenever he turned in, he smoked them all out in succession,
2714	lighting one from the other to the end of the chapter; then loading
2715	them again to be in readiness anew.  For, when Stubb dressed, instead
2716	of first putting his legs into his trowsers, he put his pipe into his
2717	mouth.
2718	
2719	I say this continual smoking must have been one cause, at least, of
2720	his peculiar disposition; for every one knows that this earthly air,
2721	whether ashore or afloat, is terribly infected with the nameless
2722	miseries of the numberless mortals who have died exhaling it; and as
2723	in time of the cholera, some people go about with a camphorated
2724	handkerchief to their mouths; so, likewise, against all mortal
2725	tribulations, Stubb's tobacco smoke might have operated as a sort of
2726	disinfecting agent.
2727	
2728	The third mate was Flask, a native of Tisbury, in Martha's Vineyard.
2729	A short, stout, ruddy young fellow, very pugnacious concerning
2730	whales, who somehow seemed to think that the great leviathans had
2731	personally and hereditarily affronted him; and therefore it was a
2732	sort of point of honour with him, to destroy them whenever
2733	encountered.  So utterly lost was he to all sense of reverence for
2734	the many marvels of their majestic bulk and mystic ways; and so dead
2735	to anything like an apprehension of any possible danger from
2736	encountering them; that in his poor opinion, the wondrous whale was
2737	but a species of magnified mouse, or at least water-rat, requiring
2738	only a little circumvention and some small application of time and
2739	trouble in order to kill and boil.  This ignorant, unconscious
2740	fearlessness of his made him a little waggish in the matter of
2741	whales; he followed these fish for the fun of it; and a three years'
2742	voyage round Cape Horn was only a jolly joke that lasted that length
2743	of time.  As a carpenter's nails are divided into wrought nails and
2744	cut nails; so mankind may be similarly divided.  Little Flask was one
2745	of the wrought ones; made to clinch tight and last long.  They called
2746	him King-Post on board of the Pequod; because, in form, he could be
2747	well likened to the short, square timber known by that name in Arctic
2748	whalers; and which by the means of many radiating side timbers
2749	inserted into it, serves to brace the ship against the icy
2750	concussions of those battering seas.
2751	
2752	Now these three mates--Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, were momentous
2753	men.  They it was who by universal prescription commanded three of the
2754	Pequod's boats as headsmen.  In that grand order of battle in which
2755	Captain Ahab would probably marshal his forces to descend on the
2756	whales, these three headsmen were as captains of companies.  Or,
2757	being armed with their long keen whaling spears, they were as a
2758	picked trio of lancers; even as the harpooneers were flingers of
2759	javelins.
2760	
2761	And since in this famous fishery, each mate or headsman, like a
2762	Gothic Knight of old, is always accompanied by his boat-steerer or
2763	harpooneer, who in certain conjunctures provides him with a fresh
2764	lance, when the former one has been badly twisted, or elbowed in the
2765	assault; and moreover, as there generally subsists between the two, a
2766	close intimacy and friendliness; it is therefore but meet, that in
2767	this place we set down who the Pequod's harpooneers were, and to what
2768	headsman each of them belonged.
2769	
2770	First of all was Queequeg, whom Starbuck, the chief mate, had
2771	selected for his squire.  But Queequeg is already known.
2772	
2773	Next was Tashtego, an unmixed Indian from Gay Head, the most westerly
2774	promontory of Martha's Vineyard, where there still exists the last
2775	remnant of a village of red men, which has long supplied the
2776	neighboring island of Nantucket with many of her most daring
2777	harpooneers.  In the fishery, they usually go by the generic name of
2778	Gay-Headers.  Tashtego's long, lean, sable hair, his high cheek
2779	bones, and black rounding eyes--for an Indian, Oriental in their
2780	largeness, but Antarctic in their glittering expression--all this
2781	sufficiently proclaimed him an inheritor of the unvitiated blood of
2782	those proud warrior hunters, who, in quest of the great New England
2783	moose, had scoured, bow in hand, the aboriginal forests of the main.
2784	But no longer snuffing in the trail of the wild beasts of the
2785	woodland, Tashtego now hunted in the wake of the great whales of the
2786	sea; the unerring harpoon of the son fitly replacing the infallible
2787	arrow of the sires.  To look at the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky
2788	limbs, you would almost have credited the superstitions of some of
2789	the earlier Puritans, and half-believed this wild Indian to be a son
2790	of the Prince of the Powers of the Air.  Tashtego was Stubb the
2791	second mate's squire.
2792	
2793	Third among the harpooneers was Daggoo, a gigantic, coal-black
2794	negro-savage, with a lion-like tread--an Ahasuerus to behold.
2795	Suspended from his ears were two golden hoops, so large that the
2796	sailors called them ring-bolts, and would talk of securing the
2797	top-sail halyards to them.  In his youth Daggoo had voluntarily
2798	shipped on board of a whaler, lying in a lonely bay on his native
2799	coast.  And never having been anywhere in the world but in Africa,
2800	Nantucket, and the pagan harbors most frequented by whalemen; and
2801	having now led for many years the bold life of the fishery in the
2802	ships of owners uncommonly heedful of what manner of men they
2803	shipped; Daggoo retained all his barbaric virtues, and erect as a
2804	giraffe, moved about the decks in all the pomp of six feet five in
2805	his socks.  There was a corporeal humility in looking up at him; and
2806	a white man standing before him seemed a white flag come to beg truce
2807	of a fortress.  Curious to tell, this imperial negro, Ahasuerus
2808	Daggoo, was the Squire of little Flask, who looked like a chess-man
2809	beside him.  As for the residue of the Pequod's company, be it said,
2810	that at the present day not one in two of the many thousand men
2811	before the mast employed in the American whale fishery, are Americans
2812	born, though pretty nearly all the officers are.  Herein it is the
2813	same with the American whale fishery as with the American army and
2814	military and merchant navies, and the engineering forces employed in
2815	the construction of the American Canals and Railroads.  The same, I
2816	say, because in all these cases the native American liberally
2817	provides the brains, the rest of the world as generously supplying
2818	the muscles.  No small number of these whaling seamen belong to the
2819	Azores, where the outward bound Nantucket whalers frequently touch to
2820	augment their crews from the hardy peasants of those rocky shores.
2821	In like manner, the Greenland whalers sailing out of Hull or London,
2822	put in at the Shetland Islands, to receive the full complement of
2823	their crew.  Upon the passage homewards, they drop them there again.
2824	How it is, there is no telling, but Islanders seem to make the best
2825	whalemen.  They were nearly all Islanders in the Pequod, ISOLATOES
2826	too, I call such, not acknowledging the common continent of men, but
2827	each ISOLATO living on a separate continent of his own.  Yet now,
2828	federated along one keel, what a set these Isolatoes were!  An
2829	Anacharsis Clootz deputation from all the isles of the sea, and all
2830	the ends of the earth, accompanying Old Ahab in the Pequod to lay the
2831	world's grievances before that bar from which not very many of them
2832	ever come back.  Black Little Pip--he never did--oh, no! he went
2833	before.  Poor Alabama boy!  On the grim Pequod's forecastle, ye shall
2834	ere long see him, beating his tambourine; prelusive of the eternal
2835	time, when sent for, to the great quarter-deck on high, he was bid
2836	strike in with angels, and beat his tambourine in glory; called a
2837	coward here, hailed a hero there!
2838

2841	CHAPTER 28
2842	
2843	Ahab.
2844	
2845	
2846	For several days after leaving Nantucket, nothing above hatches was
2847	seen of Captain Ahab.  The mates regularly relieved each other at the
2848	watches, and for aught that could be seen to the contrary, they
2849	seemed to be the only commanders of the ship; only they sometimes
2850	issued from the cabin with orders so sudden and peremptory, that
2851	after all it was plain they but commanded vicariously.  Yes, their
2852	supreme lord and dictator was there, though hitherto unseen by any
2853	eyes not permitted to penetrate into the now sacred retreat of the
2854	cabin.
2855	
2856	Every time I ascended to the deck from my watches below, I instantly
2857	gazed aft to mark if any strange face were visible; for my first
2858	vague disquietude touching the unknown captain, now in the seclusion
2859	of the sea, became almost a perturbation.  This was strangely
2860	heightened at times by the ragged Elijah's diabolical incoherences
2861	uninvitedly recurring to me, with a subtle energy I could not have
2862	before conceived of.  But poorly could I withstand them, much as in
2863	other moods I was almost ready to smile at the solemn whimsicalities
2864	of that outlandish prophet of the wharves.  But whatever it was of
2865	apprehensiveness or uneasiness--to call it so--which I felt, yet
2866	whenever I came to look about me in the ship, it seemed against all
2867	warrantry to cherish such emotions.  For though the harpooneers, with
2868	the great body of the crew, were a far more barbaric, heathenish, and
2869	motley set than any of the tame merchant-ship companies which my
2870	previous experiences had made me acquainted with, still I ascribed
2871	this--and rightly ascribed it--to the fierce uniqueness of the very
2872	nature of that wild Scandinavian vocation in which I had so
2873	abandonedly embarked.  But it was especially the aspect of the three
2874	chief officers of the ship, the mates, which was most forcibly
2875	calculated to allay these colourless misgivings, and induce confidence
2876	and cheerfulness in every presentment of the voyage.  Three better,
2877	more likely sea-officers and men, each in his own different way,
2878	could not readily be found, and they were every one of them
2879	Americans; a Nantucketer, a Vineyarder, a Cape man.  Now, it being
2880	Christmas when the ship shot from out her harbor, for a space we had
2881	biting Polar weather, though all the time running away from it to the
2882	southward; and by every degree and minute of latitude which we
2883	sailed, gradually leaving that merciless winter, and all its
2884	intolerable weather behind us.  It was one of those less lowering,
2885	but still grey and gloomy enough mornings of the transition, when
2886	with a fair wind the ship was rushing through the water with a
2887	vindictive sort of leaping and melancholy rapidity, that as I mounted
2888	to the deck at the call of the forenoon watch, so soon as I levelled
2889	my glance towards the taffrail, foreboding shivers ran over me.
2890	Reality outran apprehension; Captain Ahab stood upon his
2891	quarter-deck.
2892	
2893	There seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him, nor of the
2894	recovery from any.  He looked like a man cut away from the stake,
2895	when the fire has overrunningly wasted all the limbs without
2896	consuming them, or taking away one particle from their compacted aged
2897	robustness.  His whole high, broad form, seemed made of solid bronze,
2898	and shaped in an unalterable mould, like Cellini's cast Perseus.
2899	Threading its way out from among his grey hairs, and continuing right
2900	down one side of his tawny scorched face and neck, till it
2901	disappeared in his clothing, you saw a slender rod-like mark, lividly
2902	whitish.  It resembled that perpendicular seam sometimes made in the
2903	straight, lofty trunk of a great tree, when the upper lightning
2904	tearingly darts down it, and without wrenching a single twig, peels
2905	and grooves out the bark from top to bottom, ere running off into the
2906	soil, leaving the tree still greenly alive, but branded.  Whether
2907	that mark was born with him, or whether it was the scar left by some
2908	desperate wound, no one could certainly say.  By some tacit consent,
2909	throughout the voyage little or no allusion was made to it,
2910	especially by the mates.  But once Tashtego's senior, an old Gay-Head
2911	Indian among the crew, superstitiously asserted that not till he was
2912	full forty years old did Ahab become that way branded, and then it
2913	came upon him, not in the fury of any mortal fray, but in an
2914	elemental strife at sea.  Yet, this wild hint seemed inferentially
2915	negatived, by what a grey Manxman insinuated, an old sepulchral man,
2916	who, having never before sailed out of Nantucket, had never ere this
2917	laid eye upon wild Ahab.  Nevertheless, the old sea-traditions, the
2918	immemorial credulities, popularly invested this old Manxman with
2919	preternatural powers of discernment.  So that no white sailor
2920	seriously contradicted him when he said that if ever Captain Ahab
2921	should be tranquilly laid out--which might hardly come to pass, so he
2922	muttered--then, whoever should do that last office for the dead,
2923	would find a birth-mark on him from crown to sole.
2924	
2925	So powerfully did the whole grim aspect of Ahab affect me, and the
2926	livid brand which streaked it, that for the first few moments I
2927	hardly noted that not a little of this overbearing grimness was owing
2928	to the barbaric white leg upon which he partly stood.  It had
2929	previously come to me that this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned
2930	"from the polished bone of the sperm whale's jaw.  Aye, he was
dismasted off Japan, said the old Gay-Head Indian once; but like
his dismasted craft, he shipped another mast without coming home for
it.  He has a quiver of 'em."
2931	
2932	I was struck with the singular posture he maintained.  Upon each side
2933	of the Pequod's quarter deck, and pretty close to the mizzen shrouds,
2934	there was an auger hole, bored about half an inch or so, into the
2935	plank.  His bone leg steadied in that hole; one arm elevated, and
2936	holding by a shroud; Captain Ahab stood erect, looking straight out
2937	beyond the ship's ever-pitching prow.  There was an infinity of
2938	firmest fortitude, a determinate, unsurrenderable wilfulness, in the
2939	fixed and fearless, forward dedication of that glance.  Not a word he
2940	spoke; nor did his officers say aught to him; though by all their
2941	minutest gestures and expressions, they plainly showed the uneasy, if
2942	not painful, consciousness of being under a troubled master-eye.  And
2943	not only that, but moody stricken Ahab stood before them with a
2944	crucifixion in his face; in all the nameless regal overbearing
2945	dignity of some mighty woe.
2946	
2947	Ere long, from his first visit in the air, he withdrew into his
2948	cabin.  But after that morning, he was every day visible to the crew;
2949	either standing in his pivot-hole, or seated upon an ivory stool he
2950	had; or heavily walking the deck.  As the sky grew less gloomy;
2951	indeed, began to grow a little genial, he became still less and less
2952	a recluse; as if, when the ship had sailed from home, nothing but the
2953	dead wintry bleakness of the sea had then kept him so secluded.  And,
2954	by and by, it came to pass, that he was almost continually in the
2955	air; but, as yet, for all that he said, or perceptibly did, on the at
2956	last sunny deck, he seemed as unnecessary there as another mast.  But
2957	the Pequod was only making a passage now; not regularly cruising;
2958	nearly all whaling preparatives needing supervision the mates were
2959	fully competent to, so that there was little or nothing, out of
2960	himself, to employ or excite Ahab, now; and thus chase away, for that
2961	one interval, the clouds that layer upon layer were piled upon his
2962	brow, as ever all clouds choose the loftiest peaks to pile themselves
2963	upon.
2964	
2965	Nevertheless, ere long, the warm, warbling persuasiveness of the
2966	pleasant, holiday weather we came to, seemed gradually to charm him
2967	from his mood.  For, as when the red-cheeked, dancing girls, April
2968	and May, trip home to the wintry, misanthropic woods; even the
2969	barest, ruggedest, most thunder-cloven old oak will at least send
2970	forth some few green sprouts, to welcome such glad-hearted visitants;
2971	so Ahab did, in the end, a little respond to the playful allurings of
2972	that girlish air.  More than once did he put forth the faint blossom
2973	of a look, which, in any other man, would have soon flowered out in a
2974	smile.
2975	
2976	
2977	
2978	CHAPTER 29
2979	
2980	Enter Ahab; to Him, Stubb.
2981	
2982	
2983	Some days elapsed, and ice and icebergs all astern, the Pequod now
2984	went rolling through the bright Quito spring, which, at sea, almost
2985	perpetually reigns on the threshold of the eternal August of the
2986	Tropic.  The warmly cool, clear, ringing, perfumed, overflowing,
2987	redundant days, were as crystal goblets of Persian sherbet, heaped
2988	up--flaked up, with rose-water snow.  The starred and stately nights
2989	seemed haughty dames in jewelled velvets, nursing at home in lonely
2990	pride, the memory of their absent conquering Earls, the golden
2991	helmeted suns!  For sleeping man, 'twas hard to choose between such
2992	winsome days and such seducing nights.  But all the witcheries of
2993	that unwaning weather did not merely lend new spells and potencies to
2994	the outward world.  Inward they turned upon the soul, especially when
2995	the still mild hours of eve came on; then, memory shot her crystals
2996	as the clear ice most forms of noiseless twilights.  And all these
2997	subtle agencies, more and more they wrought on Ahab's texture.
2998	
2999	Old age is always wakeful; as if, the longer linked with life, the
3000	less man has to do with aught that looks like death.  Among
3001	sea-commanders, the old greybeards will oftenest leave their berths
3002	to visit the night-cloaked deck.  It was so with Ahab; only that now,
3003	of late, he seemed so much to live in the open air, that truly
3004	speaking, his visits were more to the cabin, than from the cabin to
3005	the planks.  It feels like going down into one's tomb,--he would
3006	"mutter to himself--for an old captain like me to be descending this
narrow scuttle, to go to my grave-dug berth."
3007	
3008	So, almost every twenty-four hours, when the watches of the night
3009	were set, and the band on deck sentinelled the slumbers of the band
3010	below; and when if a rope was to be hauled upon the forecastle, the
3011	sailors flung it not rudely down, as by day, but with some
3012	cautiousness dropt it to its place for fear of disturbing their
3013	slumbering shipmates; when this sort of steady quietude would begin
3014	to prevail, habitually, the silent steersman would watch the
3015	cabin-scuttle; and ere long the old man would emerge, gripping at the
3016	iron banister, to help his crippled way.  Some considering touch of
3017	humanity was in him; for at times like these, he usually abstained
3018	from patrolling the quarter-deck; because to his wearied mates,
3019	seeking repose within six inches of his ivory heel, such would have
3020	been the reverberating crack and din of that bony step, that their
3021	dreams would have been on the crunching teeth of sharks.  But once,
3022	the mood was on him too deep for common regardings; and as with
3023	heavy, lumber-like pace he was measuring the ship from taffrail to
3024	mainmast, Stubb, the old second mate, came up from below, with a
3025	certain unassured, deprecating humorousness, hinted that if Captain
3026	Ahab was pleased to walk the planks, then, no one could say nay; but
3027	there might be some way of muffling the noise; hinting something
3028	indistinctly and hesitatingly about a globe of tow, and the insertion
3029	into it, of the ivory heel.  Ah!  Stubb, thou didst not know Ahab
3030	then.
3031	
3032	"Am I a cannon-ball, Stubb, said Ahab, that thou wouldst wad me
that fashion?  But go thy ways; I had forgot.  Below to thy nightly
grave; where such as ye sleep between shrouds, to use ye to the
filling one at last.--Down, dog, and kennel!"
3033	
3034	Starting at the unforseen concluding exclamation of the so suddenly
3035	scornful old man, Stubb was speechless a moment; then said excitedly,
3036	"I am not used to be spoken to that way, sir; I do but less than half
like it, sir."
3037	
3038	"Avast! gritted Ahab between his set teeth, and violently moving
away, as if to avoid some passionate temptation.

No, sir; not yet, said Stubb, emboldened, I will not tamely be"
3039	"called a dog, sir.

Then be called ten times a donkey, and a mule, and an ass, and"
3040	"begone, or I'll clear the world of thee!

As he said this, Ahab advanced upon him with such overbearing terrors
in his aspect, that Stubb involuntarily retreated.

I was never served so before without giving a hard blow for it,
muttered Stubb, as he found himself descending the cabin-scuttle.
It's very queer.  Stop, Stubb; somehow, now, I don't well know"
3041	whether to go back and strike him, or--what's that?--down here on my
3042	knees and pray for him?  Yes, that was the thought coming up in me;
3043	but it would be the first time I ever DID pray.  It's queer; very
3044	queer; and he's queer too; aye, take him fore and aft, he's about the
3045	queerest old man Stubb ever sailed with.  How he flashed at me!--his
3046	eyes like powder-pans! is he mad?  Anyway there's something on his
3047	mind, as sure as there must be something on a deck when it cracks.
3048	He aint in his bed now, either, more than three hours out of the
3049	twenty-four; and he don't sleep then.  Didn't that Dough-Boy, the
3050	steward, tell me that of a morning he always finds the old man's
3051	hammock clothes all rumpled and tumbled, and the sheets down at the
3052	foot, and the coverlid almost tied into knots, and the pillow a sort
3053	of frightful hot, as though a baked brick had been on it?  A hot old
3054	man!  I guess he's got what some folks ashore call a conscience; it's
3055	a kind of Tic-Dolly-row they say--worse nor a toothache.  Well, well;
3056	I don't know what it is, but the Lord keep me from catching it.  He's
3057	full of riddles; I wonder what he goes into the after hold for, every
3058	night, as Dough-Boy tells me he suspects; what's that for, I should
3059	like to know?  Who's made appointments with him in the hold?  Ain't
3060	that queer, now?  But there's no telling, it's the old game--Here
3061	goes for a snooze.  Damn me, it's worth a fellow's while to be born
3062	into the world, if only to fall right asleep.  And now that I think
3063	of it, that's about the first thing babies do, and that's a sort of
3064	queer, too.  Damn me, but all things are queer, come to think of 'em.
3065	But that's against my principles.  Think not, is my eleventh
3066	commandment; and sleep when you can, is my twelfth--So here goes
3067	again.  But how's that? didn't he call me a dog? blazes! he called me
3068	ten times a donkey, and piled a lot of jackasses on top of THAT!  He
3069	might as well have kicked me, and done with it.  Maybe he DID kick
3070	me, and I didn't observe it, I was so taken all aback with his brow,
3071	somehow.  It flashed like a bleached bone.  What the devil's the
3072	matter with me?  I don't stand right on my legs.  Coming afoul of
3073	that old man has a sort of turned me wrong side out.  By the Lord, I
3074	must have been dreaming, though--How? how? how?--but the only way's
3075	to stash it; so here goes to hammock again; and in the morning, I'll
3076	"see how this plaguey juggling thinks over by daylight.



CHAPTER 30

The Pipe.


When Stubb had departed, Ahab stood for a while leaning over the
bulwarks; and then, as had been usual with him of late, calling a
sailor of the watch, he sent him below for his ivory stool, and also
his pipe.  Lighting the pipe at the binnacle lamp and planting the
stool on the weather side of the deck, he sat and smoked.

In old Norse times, the thrones of the sea-loving Danish kings were
fabricated, saith tradition, of the tusks of the narwhale.  How could
one look at Ahab then, seated on that tripod of bones, without
bethinking him of the royalty it symbolized?  For a Khan of the
plank, and a king of the sea, and a great lord of Leviathans was
Ahab.

Some moments passed, during which the thick vapour came from his mouth
in quick and constant puffs, which blew back again into his face.
How now, he soliloquized at last, withdrawing the tube, this"
3077	smoking no longer soothes.  Oh, my pipe! hard must it go with me if
3078	thy charm be gone!  Here have I been unconsciously toiling, not
3079	pleasuring--aye, and ignorantly smoking to windward all the while; to
3080	windward, and with such nervous whiffs, as if, like the dying whale,
3081	my final jets were the strongest and fullest of trouble.  What
3082	business have I with this pipe?  This thing that is meant for
3083	sereneness, to send up mild white vapours among mild white hairs, not
3084	"among torn iron-grey locks like mine.  I'll smoke no more--

He tossed the still lighted pipe into the sea.  The fire hissed in
the waves; the same instant the ship shot by the bubble the sinking
pipe made.  With slouched hat, Ahab lurchingly paced the planks.



CHAPTER 31

Queen Mab.


Next morning Stubb accosted Flask.

Such a queer dream, King-Post, I never had.  You know the old man's"
3085	ivory leg, well I dreamed he kicked me with it; and when I tried to
3086	kick back, upon my soul, my little man, I kicked my leg right off!
3087	And then, presto!  Ahab seemed a pyramid, and I, like a blazing fool,
3088	kept kicking at it.  But what was still more curious, Flask--you know
3089	how curious all dreams are--through all this rage that I was in, I
3090	somehow seemed to be thinking to myself, that after all, it was not
3091	much of an insult, that kick from Ahab.  'Why,' thinks I, 'what's the
3092	row?  It's not a real leg, only a false leg.'  And there's a mighty
3093	difference between a living thump and a dead thump.  That's what
3094	makes a blow from the hand, Flask, fifty times more savage to bear
3095	than a blow from a cane.  The living member--that makes the living
3096	insult, my little man.  And thinks I to myself all the while, mind,
3097	while I was stubbing my silly toes against that cursed pyramid--so
3098	confoundedly contradictory was it all, all the while, I say, I was
3099	thinking to myself, 'what's his leg now, but a cane--a whalebone
3100	cane.  Yes,' thinks I, 'it was only a playful cudgelling--in fact,
3101	only a whaleboning that he gave me--not a base kick.  Besides,'
3102	thinks I, 'look at it once; why, the end of it--the foot part--what a
3103	small sort of end it is; whereas, if a broad footed farmer kicked me,
3104	THERE'S a devilish broad insult.  But this insult is whittled down to
3105	a point only.'  But now comes the greatest joke of the dream, Flask.
3106	While I was battering away at the pyramid, a sort of badger-haired
3107	old merman, with a hump on his back, takes me by the shoulders, and
3108	slews me round.  'What are you 'bout?' says he.  Slid! man, but I was
3109	frightened.  Such a phiz!  But, somehow, next moment I was over the
3110	fright.  'What am I about?' says I at last.  'And what business is
3111	that of yours, I should like to know, Mr. Humpback?  Do YOU want a
3112	kick?'  By the lord, Flask, I had no sooner said that, than he turned
3113	round his stern to me, bent over, and dragging up a lot of seaweed he
3114	had for a clout--what do you think, I saw?--why thunder alive, man,
3115	his stern was stuck full of marlinspikes, with the points out.  Says
3116	I, on second thoughts, 'I guess I won't kick you, old fellow.'  'Wise
3117	Stubb,' said he, 'wise Stubb;' and kept muttering it all the time, a
3118	sort of eating of his own gums like a chimney hag.  Seeing he wasn't
3119	going to stop saying over his 'wise Stubb, wise Stubb,' I thought I
3120	might as well fall to kicking the pyramid again.  But I had only just
3121	lifted my foot for it, when he roared out, 'Stop that kicking!'
3122	'Halloa,' says I, 'what's the matter now, old fellow?'  'Look ye
3123	here,' says he; 'let's argue the insult.  Captain Ahab kicked ye,
3124	didn't he?'  'Yes, he did,' says I--'right HERE it was.'  'Very
3125	good,' says he--'he used his ivory leg, didn't he?'  'Yes, he did,'
3126	says I.  'Well then,' says he, 'wise Stubb, what have you to complain
3127	of?  Didn't he kick with right good will? it wasn't a common pitch
3128	pine leg he kicked with, was it?  No, you were kicked by a great man,
3129	and with a beautiful ivory leg, Stubb.  It's an honour; I consider it
3130	an honour.  Listen, wise Stubb.  In old England the greatest lords
3131	think it great glory to be slapped by a queen, and made
3132	garter-knights of; but, be YOUR boast, Stubb, that ye were kicked by
3133	old Ahab, and made a wise man of.  Remember what I say; BE kicked by
3134	him; account his kicks honours; and on no account kick back; for you
3135	can't help yourself, wise Stubb.  Don't you see that pyramid?'  With
3136	that, he all of a sudden seemed somehow, in some queer fashion, to
3137	swim off into the air.  I snored; rolled over; and there I was in my
3138	"hammock!  Now, what do you think of that dream, Flask?

I don't know; it seems a sort of foolish to me, tho.'

May be; may be.  But it's made a wise man of me, Flask.  D'ye see"
3139	Ahab standing there, sideways looking over the stern?  Well, the best
3140	thing you can do, Flask, is to let the old man alone; never speak to
3141	"him, whatever he says.  Halloa!  What's that he shouts?  Hark!

Mast-head, there!  Look sharp, all of ye!  There are whales"
3142	hereabouts!
3143	
3144	If ye see a white one, split your lungs for him!
3145	
3146	"What do you think of that now, Flask? ain't there a small drop of
something queer about that, eh?  A white whale--did ye mark that,
man?  Look ye--there's something special in the wind.  Stand by for
it, Flask.  Ahab has that that's bloody on his mind.  But, mum; he
comes this way."
3147	
3148	
3149	
3150	CHAPTER 32
3151	
3152	Cetology.
3153	
3154	
3155	Already we are boldly launched upon the deep; but soon we shall be
3156	lost in its unshored, harbourless immensities.  Ere that come to pass;
3157	ere the Pequod's weedy hull rolls side by side with the barnacled
3158	hulls of the leviathan; at the outset it is but well to attend to a
3159	matter almost indispensable to a thorough appreciative understanding
3160	of the more special leviathanic revelations and allusions of all
3161	sorts which are to follow.
3162	
3163	It is some systematized exhibition of the whale in his broad genera,
3164	that I would now fain put before you.  Yet is it no easy task.  The
3165	classification of the constituents of a chaos, nothing less is here
3166	essayed.  Listen to what the best and latest authorities have laid
3167	down.
3168	
3169	"No branch of Zoology is so much involved as that which is entitled
Cetology, says Captain Scoresby, A.D. 1820."
3170	
3171	"It is not my intention, were it in my power, to enter into the
inquiry as to the true method of dividing the cetacea into groups and
families....  Utter confusion exists among the historians of this
animal (sperm whale), says Surgeon Beale, A.D. 1839."
3172	
3173	Unfitness to pursue our research in the unfathomable waters.
3174	"Impenetrable veil covering our knowledge of the cetacea.  A field
strewn with thorns.  All these incomplete indications but serve to
torture us naturalists."
3175	
3176	Thus speak of the whale, the great Cuvier, and John Hunter, and
3177	Lesson, those lights of zoology and anatomy.  Nevertheless, though of
3178	real knowledge there be little, yet of books there are a plenty; and
3179	so in some small degree, with cetology, or the science of whales.
3180	Many are the men, small and great, old and new, landsmen and seamen,
3181	who have at large or in little, written of the whale.  Run over a
3182	few:--The Authors of the Bible; Aristotle; Pliny; Aldrovandi; Sir
3183	Thomas Browne; Gesner; Ray; Linnaeus; Rondeletius; Willoughby; Green;
3184	Artedi; Sibbald; Brisson; Marten; Lacepede; Bonneterre; Desmarest;
3185	Baron Cuvier; Frederick Cuvier; John Hunter; Owen; Scoresby; Beale;
3186	Bennett; J.  Ross Browne; the Author of Miriam Coffin; Olmstead; and
3187	the Rev.  T.  Cheever.  But to what ultimate generalizing purpose all
3188	these have written, the above cited extracts will show.
3189	
3190	Of the names in this list of whale authors, only those following Owen
3191	ever saw living whales; and but one of them was a real professional
3192	harpooneer and whaleman.  I mean Captain Scoresby.  On the separate
3193	subject of the Greenland or right-whale, he is the best existing
3194	authority.  But Scoresby knew nothing and says nothing of the great
3195	sperm whale, compared with which the Greenland whale is almost
3196	unworthy mentioning.  And here be it said, that the Greenland whale
3197	is an usurper upon the throne of the seas.  He is not even by any
3198	means the largest of the whales.  Yet, owing to the long priority of
3199	his claims, and the profound ignorance which, till some seventy years
3200	back, invested the then fabulous or utterly unknown sperm-whale, and
3201	which ignorance to this present day still reigns in all but some few
3202	scientific retreats and whale-ports; this usurpation has been every
3203	way complete.  Reference to nearly all the leviathanic allusions in
3204	the great poets of past days, will satisfy you that the Greenland
3205	whale, without one rival, was to them the monarch of the seas.  But
3206	the time has at last come for a new proclamation.  This is Charing
3207	Cross; hear ye! good people all,--the Greenland whale is
3208	deposed,--the great sperm whale now reigneth!
3209	
3210	There are only two books in being which at all pretend to put the
3211	living sperm whale before you, and at the same time, in the remotest
3212	degree succeed in the attempt.  Those books are Beale's and
3213	Bennett's; both in their time surgeons to English South-Sea
3214	whale-ships, and both exact and reliable men.  The original matter
3215	touching the sperm whale to be found in their volumes is necessarily
3216	small; but so far as it goes, it is of excellent quality, though
3217	mostly confined to scientific description.  As yet, however, the
3218	sperm whale, scientific or poetic, lives not complete in any
3219	literature.  Far above all other hunted whales, his is an unwritten
3220	life.
3221	
3222	Now the various species of whales need some sort of popular
3223	comprehensive classification, if only an easy outline one for the
3224	present, hereafter to be filled in all its departments by subsequent
3225	laborers.  As no better man advances to take this matter in hand, I
3226	hereupon offer my own poor endeavors.  I promise nothing complete;
3227	because any human thing supposed to be complete, must for that very
3228	reason infallibly be faulty.  I shall not pretend to a minute
3229	anatomical description of the various species, or--in this place at
3230	least--to much of any description.  My object here is simply to
3231	project the draught of a systematization of cetology.  I am the
3232	architect, not the builder.
3233	
3234	But it is a ponderous task; no ordinary letter-sorter in the
3235	Post-Office is equal to it.  To grope down into the bottom of the sea
3236	after them; to have one's hands among the unspeakable foundations,
3237	ribs, and very pelvis of the world; this is a fearful thing.  What am
3238	I that I should essay to hook the nose of this leviathan!  The awful
3239	"tauntings in Job might well appal me.  Will he the (leviathan) make
a covenant with thee?  Behold the hope of him is vain!  But I have
swam through libraries and sailed through oceans; I have had to do
with whales with these visible hands; I am in earnest; and I will
try.  There are some preliminaries to settle.

First: The uncertain, unsettled condition of this science of Cetology
is in the very vestibule attested by the fact, that in some quarters
it still remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish.  In his
System of Nature, A.D. 1776, Linnaeus declares, I hereby separate"
3240	"the whales from the fish.  But of my own knowledge, I know that down
to the year 1850, sharks and shad, alewives and herring, against
Linnaeus's express edict, were still found dividing the possession of
the same seas with the Leviathan.

The grounds upon which Linnaeus would fain have banished the whales
from the waters, he states as follows: On account of their warm"
3241	bilocular heart, their lungs, their movable eyelids, their hollow
3242	ears, penem intrantem feminam mammis lactantem, and finally, ex
3243	"lege naturae jure meritoque.  I submitted all this to my friends
Simeon Macey and Charley Coffin, of Nantucket, both messmates of mine
in a certain voyage, and they united in the opinion that the reasons
set forth were altogether insufficient.  Charley profanely hinted
they were humbug.

Be it known that, waiving all argument, I take the good old fashioned
ground that the whale is a fish, and call upon holy Jonah to back me.
This fundamental thing settled, the next point is, in what internal
respect does the whale differ from other fish.  Above, Linnaeus has
given you those items.  But in brief, they are these: lungs and warm
blood; whereas, all other fish are lungless and cold blooded.

Next: how shall we define the whale, by his obvious externals, so as
conspicuously to label him for all time to come?  To be short, then,
a whale is A SPOUTING FISH WITH A HORIZONTAL TAIL.  There you have
him.  However contracted, that definition is the result of expanded
meditation.  A walrus spouts much like a whale, but the walrus is not
a fish, because he is amphibious.  But the last term of the
definition is still more cogent, as coupled with the first.  Almost
any one must have noticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have
not a flat, but a vertical, or up-and-down tail.  Whereas, among
spouting fish the tail, though it may be similarly shaped, invariably
assumes a horizontal position.

By the above definition of what a whale is, I do by no means exclude
from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified
with the whale by the best informed Nantucketers; nor, on the other
hand, link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as
alien.*  Hence, all the smaller, spouting, and horizontal tailed fish
must be included in this ground-plan of Cetology.  Now, then, come
the grand divisions of the entire whale host.


*I am aware that down to the present time, the fish styled Lamatins
and Dugongs (Pig-fish and Sow-fish of the Coffins of Nantucket) are
included by many naturalists among the whales.  But as these pig-fish
are a noisy, contemptible set, mostly lurking in the mouths of
rivers, and feeding on wet hay, and especially as they do not spout,
I deny their credentials as whales; and have presented them with
their passports to quit the Kingdom of Cetology.


First: According to magnitude I divide the whales into three primary
BOOKS (subdivisible into CHAPTERS), and these shall comprehend them
all, both small and large.

I. THE FOLIO WHALE; II. the OCTAVO WHALE; III. the DUODECIMO WHALE.

As the type of the FOLIO I present the SPERM WHALE; of the OCTAVO,
the GRAMPUS; of the DUODECIMO, the PORPOISE.

FOLIOS.  Among these I here include the following chapters:--I. The
SPERM WHALE; II. the RIGHT WHALE; III. the FIN-BACK WHALE; IV. the
HUMP-BACKED WHALE; V. the RAZOR-BACK WHALE; VI. the SULPHUR-BOTTOM
WHALE.

BOOK I. (FOLIO), CHAPTER I. (SPERM WHALE).--This whale, among the
English of old vaguely known as the Trumpa whale, and the Physeter
whale, and the Anvil Headed whale, is the present Cachalot of the
French, and the Pottsfich of the Germans, and the Macrocephalus of
the Long Words.  He is, without doubt, the largest inhabitant of the
globe; the most formidable of all whales to encounter; the most
majestic in aspect; and lastly, by far the most valuable in commerce;
he being the only creature from which that valuable substance,
spermaceti, is obtained.  All his peculiarities will, in many other
places, be enlarged upon.  It is chiefly with his name that I now
have to do.  Philologically considered, it is absurd.  Some centuries
ago, when the Sperm whale was almost wholly unknown in his own
proper individuality, and when his oil was only accidentally obtained
from the stranded fish; in those days spermaceti, it would seem, was
popularly supposed to be derived from a creature identical with the
one then known in England as the Greenland or Right Whale.  It was
the idea also, that this same spermaceti was that quickening humor of
the Greenland Whale which the first syllable of the word literally
expresses.  In those times, also, spermaceti was exceedingly scarce,
not being used for light, but only as an ointment and medicament.  It
was only to be had from the druggists as you nowadays buy an ounce of
rhubarb.  When, as I opine, in the course of time, the true nature of
spermaceti became known, its original name was still retained by the
dealers; no doubt to enhance its value by a notion so strangely
significant of its scarcity.  And so the appellation must at last
have come to be bestowed upon the whale from which this spermaceti
was really derived.

BOOK I. (FOLIO), CHAPTER II. (RIGHT WHALE).--In one respect this is
the most venerable of the leviathans, being the one first regularly
hunted by man.  It yields the article commonly known as whalebone or
baleen; and the oil specially known as whale oil, an inferior
article in commerce.  Among the fishermen, he is indiscriminately
designated by all the following titles: The Whale; the Greenland
Whale; the Black Whale; the Great Whale; the True Whale; the Right
Whale.  There is a deal of obscurity concerning the identity of the
species thus multitudinously baptised.  What then is the whale, which
I include in the second species of my Folios?  It is the Great
Mysticetus of the English naturalists; the Greenland Whale of the
English whalemen; the Baliene Ordinaire of the French whalemen; the
Growlands Walfish of the Swedes.  It is the whale which for more than
two centuries past has been hunted by the Dutch and English in the
Arctic seas; it is the whale which the American fishermen have long
pursued in the Indian ocean, on the Brazil Banks, on the Nor' West
Coast, and various other parts of the world, designated by them Right
Whale Cruising Grounds.

Some pretend to see a difference between the Greenland whale of the
English and the right whale of the Americans.  But they precisely
agree in all their grand features; nor has there yet been presented a
single determinate fact upon which to ground a radical distinction.
It is by endless subdivisions based upon the most inconclusive
differences, that some departments of natural history become so
repellingly intricate.  The right whale will be elsewhere treated of
at some length, with reference to elucidating the sperm whale.

BOOK I. (FOLIO), CHAPTER III. (FIN-BACK).--Under this head I reckon a
monster which, by the various names of Fin-Back, Tall-Spout, and
Long-John, has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the
whale whose distant jet is so often descried by passengers crossing
the Atlantic, in the New York packet-tracks.  In the length he
attains, and in his baleen, the Fin-back resembles the right whale,
but is of a less portly girth, and a lighter colour, approaching to
olive.  His great lips present a cable-like aspect, formed by the
intertwisting, slanting folds of large wrinkles.  His grand
distinguishing feature, the fin, from which he derives his name, is
often a conspicuous object.  This fin is some three or four feet
long, growing vertically from the hinder part of the back, of an
angular shape, and with a very sharp pointed end.  Even if not the
slightest other part of the creature be visible, this isolated fin
will, at times, be seen plainly projecting from the surface.  When
the sea is moderately calm, and slightly marked with spherical
ripples, and this gnomon-like fin stands up and casts shadows upon
the wrinkled surface, it may well be supposed that the watery circle
surrounding it somewhat resembles a dial, with its style and wavy
hour-lines graved on it.  On that Ahaz-dial the shadow often goes
back.  The Fin-Back is not gregarious.  He seems a whale-hater, as
some men are man-haters.  Very shy; always going solitary;
unexpectedly rising to the surface in the remotest and most sullen
waters; his straight and single lofty jet rising like a tall
misanthropic spear upon a barren plain; gifted with such wondrous
power and velocity in swimming, as to defy all present pursuit from
man; this leviathan seems the banished and unconquerable Cain of his
race, bearing for his mark that style upon his back.  From having the
baleen in his mouth, the Fin-Back is sometimes included with the
right whale, among a theoretic species denominated WHALEBONE WHALES,
that is, whales with baleen.  Of these so called Whalebone whales,
there would seem to be several varieties, most of which, however, are
little known.  Broad-nosed whales and beaked whales; pike-headed
whales; bunched whales; under-jawed whales and rostrated whales, are
the fishermen's names for a few sorts.

In connection with this appellative of Whalebone whales, it is of
great importance to mention, that however such a nomenclature may be
convenient in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales, yet it
is in vain to attempt a clear classification of the Leviathan,
founded upon either his baleen, or hump, or fin, or teeth;
notwithstanding that those marked parts or features very obviously
seem better adapted to afford the basis for a regular system of
Cetology than any other detached bodily distinctions, which the
whale, in his kinds, presents.  How then?  The baleen, hump,
back-fin, and teeth; these are things whose peculiarities are
indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales, without any
regard to what may be the nature of their structure in other and
more essential particulars.  Thus, the sperm whale and the humpbacked
whale, each has a hump; but there the similitude ceases.  Then, this
same humpbacked whale and the Greenland whale, each of these has
baleen; but there again the similitude ceases.  And it is just the
same with the other parts above mentioned.  In various sorts of
whales, they form such irregular combinations; or, in the case of any
one of them detached, such an irregular isolation; as utterly to defy
all general methodization formed upon such a basis.  On this rock
every one of the whale-naturalists has split.

But it may possibly be conceived that, in the internal parts of the
whale, in his anatomy--there, at least, we shall be able to hit the
right classification.  Nay; what thing, for example, is there in the
Greenland whale's anatomy more striking than his baleen?  Yet we have
seen that by his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify the
Greenland whale.  And if you descend into the bowels of the various
leviathans, why there you will not find distinctions a fiftieth part
as available to the systematizer as those external ones already
enumerated.  What then remains? nothing but to take hold of the
whales bodily, in their entire liberal volume, and boldly sort them
that way.  And this is the Bibliographical system here adopted; and
it is the only one that can possibly succeed, for it alone is
practicable.  To proceed.

BOOK I. (FOLIO) CHAPTER IV. (HUMP-BACK).--This whale is often seen on
the northern American coast.  He has been frequently captured there,
and towed into harbor.  He has a great pack on him like a peddler; or
you might call him the Elephant and Castle whale.  At any rate, the
popular name for him does not sufficiently distinguish him, since the
sperm whale also has a hump though a smaller one.  His oil is not
very valuable.  He has baleen.  He is the most gamesome and
light-hearted of all the whales, making more gay foam and white water
generally than any other of them.

BOOK I. (FOLIO), CHAPTER V. (RAZOR-BACK).--Of this whale little is
known but his name.  I have seen him at a distance off Cape Horn.  Of
a retiring nature, he eludes both hunters and philosophers.  Though
no coward, he has never yet shown any part of him but his back, which
rises in a long sharp ridge.  Let him go.  I know little more of him,
nor does anybody else.

BOOK I. (FOLIO), CHAPTER VI. (SULPHUR-BOTTOM).--Another retiring
gentleman, with a brimstone belly, doubtless got by scraping along
the Tartarian tiles in some of his profounder divings.  He is seldom
seen; at least I have never seen him except in the remoter southern
seas, and then always at too great a distance to study his
countenance.  He is never chased; he would run away with rope-walks
of line.  Prodigies are told of him.  Adieu, Sulphur Bottom!  I can
say nothing more that is true of ye, nor can the oldest Nantucketer.

Thus ends BOOK I. (FOLIO), and now begins BOOK II. (OCTAVO).

OCTAVOES.*--These embrace the whales of middling magnitude, among
which present may be numbered:--I., the GRAMPUS; II., the BLACK FISH;
III., the NARWHALE; IV., the THRASHER; V., the KILLER.


*Why this book of whales is not denominated the Quarto is very plain.
Because, while the whales of this order, though smaller than those
of the former order, nevertheless retain a proportionate likeness to
them in figure, yet the bookbinder's Quarto volume in its dimensioned
form does not preserve the shape of the Folio volume, but the Octavo
volume does.


BOOK II. (OCTAVO), CHAPTER I. (GRAMPUS).--Though this fish, whose
loud sonorous breathing, or rather blowing, has furnished a proverb
to landsmen, is so well known a denizen of the deep, yet is he not
popularly classed among whales.  But possessing all the grand
distinctive features of the leviathan, most naturalists have
recognised him for one.  He is of moderate octavo size, varying from
fifteen to twenty-five feet in length, and of corresponding
dimensions round the waist.  He swims in herds; he is never regularly
hunted, though his oil is considerable in quantity, and pretty good
for light.  By some fishermen his approach is regarded as premonitory
of the advance of the great sperm whale.

BOOK II. (OCTAVO), CHAPTER II. (BLACK FISH).--I give the popular
fishermen's names for all these fish, for generally they are the
best.  Where any name happens to be vague or inexpressive, I shall
say so, and suggest another.  I do so now, touching the Black Fish,
so-called, because blackness is the rule among almost all whales.
So, call him the Hyena Whale, if you please.  His voracity is well
known, and from the circumstance that the inner angles of his lips
are curved upwards, he carries an everlasting Mephistophelean grin on
his face.  This whale averages some sixteen or eighteen feet in
length.  He is found in almost all latitudes.  He has a peculiar way
of showing his dorsal hooked fin in swimming, which looks something
like a Roman nose.  When not more profitably employed, the sperm
whale hunters sometimes capture the Hyena whale, to keep up the
supply of cheap oil for domestic employment--as some frugal
housekeepers, in the absence of company, and quite alone by
themselves, burn unsavory tallow instead of odorous wax.  Though
their blubber is very thin, some of these whales will yield you
upwards of thirty gallons of oil.

BOOK II. (OCTAVO), CHAPTER III. (NARWHALE), that is, NOSTRIL
WHALE.--Another instance of a curiously named whale, so named I
suppose from his peculiar horn being originally mistaken for a peaked
nose.  The creature is some sixteen feet in length, while its horn
averages five feet, though some exceed ten, and even attain to
fifteen feet.  Strictly speaking, this horn is but a lengthened tusk,
growing out from the jaw in a line a little depressed from the
horizontal.  But it is only found on the sinister side, which has an
ill effect, giving its owner something analogous to the aspect of a
clumsy left-handed man.  What precise purpose this ivory horn or
lance answers, it would be hard to say.  It does not seem to be used
like the blade of the sword-fish and bill-fish; though some sailors
tell me that the Narwhale employs it for a rake in turning over the
bottom of the sea for food.  Charley Coffin said it was used for an
ice-piercer; for the Narwhale, rising to the surface of the Polar
Sea, and finding it sheeted with ice, thrusts his horn up, and so
breaks through.  But you cannot prove either of these surmises to be
correct.  My own opinion is, that however this one-sided horn may
really be used by the Narwhale--however that may be--it would
certainly be very convenient to him for a folder in reading
pamphlets.  The Narwhale I have heard called the Tusked whale, the
Horned whale, and the Unicorn whale.  He is certainly a curious
example of the Unicornism to be found in almost every kingdom of
animated nature.  From certain cloistered old authors I have gathered
that this same sea-unicorn's horn was in ancient days regarded as the
great antidote against poison, and as such, preparations of it
brought immense prices.  It was also distilled to a volatile salts
for fainting ladies, the same way that the horns of the male deer are
manufactured into hartshorn.  Originally it was in itself accounted
an object of great curiosity.  Black Letter tells me that Sir Martin
Frobisher on his return from that voyage, when Queen Bess did
gallantly wave her jewelled hand to him from a window of Greenwich
Palace, as his bold ship sailed down the Thames; when Sir Martin"
3244	returned from that voyage, saith Black Letter, on bended knees he
3245	presented to her highness a prodigious long horn of the Narwhale,
3246	"which for a long period after hung in the castle at Windsor.  An
Irish author avers that the Earl of Leicester, on bended knees, did
likewise present to her highness another horn, pertaining to a land
beast of the unicorn nature.

The Narwhale has a very picturesque, leopard-like look, being of a
milk-white ground colour, dotted with round and oblong spots of black.
His oil is very superior, clear and fine; but there is little of it,
and he is seldom hunted.  He is mostly found in the circumpolar seas.

BOOK II. (OCTAVO), CHAPTER IV. (KILLER).--Of this whale little is
precisely known to the Nantucketer, and nothing at all to the
professed naturalist.  From what I have seen of him at a distance,
I should say that he was about the bigness of a grampus.  He is very
savage--a sort of Feegee fish.  He sometimes takes the great Folio
whales by the lip, and hangs there like a leech, till the mighty
brute is worried to death.  The Killer is never hunted.  I never
heard what sort of oil he has.  Exception might be taken to the name
bestowed upon this whale, on the ground of its indistinctness.  For
we are all killers, on land and on sea; Bonapartes and Sharks
included.

BOOK II. (OCTAVO), CHAPTER V. (THRASHER).--This gentleman is famous
for his tail, which he uses for a ferule in thrashing his foes.  He
mounts the Folio whale's back, and as he swims, he works his passage
by flogging him; as some schoolmasters get along in the world by a
similar process.  Still less is known of the Thrasher than of the
Killer.  Both are outlaws, even in the lawless seas.

Thus ends BOOK II. (OCTAVO), and begins BOOK III. (DUODECIMO).

DUODECIMOES.--These include the smaller whales.  I. The Huzza
Porpoise.  II. The Algerine Porpoise.  III. The Mealy-mouthed
Porpoise.

To those who have not chanced specially to study the subject, it may
possibly seem strange, that fishes not commonly exceeding four or
five feet should be marshalled among WHALES--a word, which, in the
popular sense, always conveys an idea of hugeness.  But the creatures
set down above as Duodecimoes are infallibly whales, by the terms of
my definition of what a whale is--i.e. a spouting fish, with a
horizontal tail.

BOOK III. (DUODECIMO), CHAPTER 1. (HUZZA PORPOISE).--This is the
common porpoise found almost all over the globe.  The name is of my
own bestowal; for there are more than one sort of porpoises, and
something must be done to distinguish them.  I call him thus, because
he always swims in hilarious shoals, which upon the broad sea keep
tossing themselves to heaven like caps in a Fourth-of-July crowd.
Their appearance is generally hailed with delight by the mariner.
Full of fine spirits, they invariably come from the breezy billows to
windward.  They are the lads that always live before the wind.  They
are accounted a lucky omen.  If you yourself can withstand three
cheers at beholding these vivacious fish, then heaven help ye; the
spirit of godly gamesomeness is not in ye.  A well-fed, plump Huzza
Porpoise will yield you one good gallon of good oil.  But the fine
and delicate fluid extracted from his jaws is exceedingly valuable.
It is in request among jewellers and watchmakers.  Sailors put it on
their hones.  Porpoise meat is good eating, you know.  It may never
have occurred to you that a porpoise spouts.  Indeed, his spout is so
small that it is not very readily discernible.  But the next time you
have a chance, watch him; and you will then see the great Sperm whale
himself in miniature.

BOOK III. (DUODECIMO), CHAPTER II. (ALGERINE PORPOISE).--A pirate.
Very savage.  He is only found, I think, in the Pacific.  He is
somewhat larger than the Huzza Porpoise, but much of the same general
make.  Provoke him, and he will buckle to a shark.  I have lowered
for him many times, but never yet saw him captured.

BOOK III. (DUODECIMO), CHAPTER III. (MEALY-MOUTHED PORPOISE).--The
largest kind of Porpoise; and only found in the Pacific, so far as it
is known.  The only English name, by which he has hitherto been
designated, is that of the fishers--Right-Whale Porpoise, from the
circumstance that he is chiefly found in the vicinity of that Folio.
In shape, he differs in some degree from the Huzza Porpoise, being of
a less rotund and jolly girth; indeed, he is of quite a neat and
gentleman-like figure.  He has no fins on his back (most other
porpoises have), he has a lovely tail, and sentimental Indian eyes of
a hazel hue.  But his mealy-mouth spoils all.  Though his entire
back down to his side fins is of a deep sable, yet a boundary line,
distinct as the mark in a ship's hull, called the bright waist,
that line streaks him from stem to stern, with two separate colours,
black above and white below.  The white comprises part of his head,
and the whole of his mouth, which makes him look as if he had just
escaped from a felonious visit to a meal-bag.  A most mean and mealy
aspect!  His oil is much like that of the common porpoise.


Beyond the DUODECIMO, this system does not proceed, inasmuch as the
Porpoise is the smallest of the whales.  Above, you have all the
Leviathans of note.  But there are a rabble of uncertain, fugitive,
half-fabulous whales, which, as an American whaleman, I know by
reputation, but not personally.  I shall enumerate them by their
fore-castle appellations; for possibly such a list may be valuable to
future investigators, who may complete what I have here but begun.
If any of the following whales, shall hereafter be caught and marked,
then he can readily be incorporated into this System, according to
his Folio, Octavo, or Duodecimo magnitude:--The Bottle-Nose Whale;
the Junk Whale; the Pudding-Headed Whale; the Cape Whale; the Leading
Whale; the Cannon Whale; the Scragg Whale; the Coppered Whale; the
Elephant Whale; the Iceberg Whale; the Quog Whale; the Blue Whale; etc.
From Icelandic, Dutch, and old English authorities, there might
be quoted other lists of uncertain whales, blessed with all manner of
uncouth names.  But I omit them as altogether obsolete; and can
hardly help suspecting them for mere sounds, full of Leviathanism,
but signifying nothing.

Finally: It was stated at the outset, that this system would not be
here, and at once, perfected.  You cannot but plainly see that I have
kept my word.  But I now leave my cetological System standing thus
unfinished, even as the great Cathedral of Cologne was left, with the
crane still standing upon the top of the uncompleted tower.  For
small erections may be finished by their first architects; grand
ones, true ones, ever leave the copestone to posterity.  God keep me
from ever completing anything.  This whole book is but a
draught--nay, but the draught of a draught.  Oh, Time, Strength,
Cash, and Patience!



CHAPTER 33

The Specksynder.


Concerning the officers of the whale-craft, this seems as good a
place as any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on ship-board,
arising from the existence of the harpooneer class of officers, a
class unknown of course in any other marine than the whale-fleet.

The large importance attached to the harpooneer's vocation is evinced
by the fact, that originally in the old Dutch Fishery, two centuries
and more ago, the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in
the person now called the captain, but was divided between him and an
officer called the Specksynder.  Literally this word means
Fat-Cutter; usage, however, in time made it equivalent to Chief
Harpooneer.  In those days, the captain's authority was restricted to
the navigation and general management of the vessel; while over the
whale-hunting department and all its concerns, the Specksynder or
Chief Harpooneer reigned supreme.  In the British Greenland Fishery,
under the corrupted title of Specksioneer, this old Dutch official is
still retained, but his former dignity is sadly abridged.  At present
he ranks simply as senior Harpooneer; and as such, is but one of the
captain's more inferior subalterns.  Nevertheless, as upon the good
conduct of the harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely
depends, and since in the American Fishery he is not only an
important officer in the boat, but under certain circumstances (night
watches on a whaling ground) the command of the ship's deck is also
his; therefore the grand political maxim of the sea demands, that he
should nominally live apart from the men before the mast, and be in
some way distinguished as their professional superior; though always,
by them, familiarly regarded as their social equal.

Now, the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea, is
this--the first lives aft, the last forward.  Hence, in whale-ships
and merchantmen alike, the mates have their quarters with the
captain; and so, too, in most of the American whalers the harpooneers
are lodged in the after part of the ship.  That is to say, they take
their meals in the captain's cabin, and sleep in a place indirectly
communicating with it.

Though the long period of a Southern whaling voyage (by far the
longest of all voyages now or ever made by man), the peculiar perils
of it, and the community of interest prevailing among a company, all
of whom, high or low, depend for their profits, not upon fixed wages,
but upon their common luck, together with their common vigilance,
intrepidity, and hard work; though all these things do in some cases
tend to beget a less rigorous discipline than in merchantmen
generally; yet, never mind how much like an old Mesopotamian family
these whalemen may, in some primitive instances, live together; for
all that, the punctilious externals, at least, of the quarter-deck
are seldom materially relaxed, and in no instance done away.  Indeed,
many are the Nantucket ships in which you will see the skipper
parading his quarter-deck with an elated grandeur not surpassed in
any military navy; nay, extorting almost as much outward homage as if
he wore the imperial purple, and not the shabbiest of pilot-cloth.

And though of all men the moody captain of the Pequod was the least
given to that sort of shallowest assumption; and though the only
homage he ever exacted, was implicit, instantaneous obedience; though
he required no man to remove the shoes from his feet ere stepping
upon the quarter-deck; and though there were times when, owing to
peculiar circumstances connected with events hereafter to be
detailed, he addressed them in unusual terms, whether of
condescension or IN TERROREM, or otherwise; yet even Captain Ahab was
by no means unobservant of the paramount forms and usages of the sea.

Nor, perhaps, will it fail to be eventually perceived, that behind
those forms and usages, as it were, he sometimes masked himself;
incidentally making use of them for other and more private ends than
they were legitimately intended to subserve.  That certain sultanism
of his brain, which had otherwise in a good degree remained
unmanifested; through those forms that same sultanism became
incarnate in an irresistible dictatorship.  For be a man's
intellectual superiority what it will, it can never assume the
practical, available supremacy over other men, without the aid of
some sort of external arts and entrenchments, always, in themselves,
more or less paltry and base.  This it is, that for ever keeps God's
true princes of the Empire from the world's hustings; and leaves the
highest honours that this air can give, to those men who become famous
more through their infinite inferiority to the choice hidden handful
of the Divine Inert, than through their undoubted superiority over
the dead level of the mass.  Such large virtue lurks in these small
things when extreme political superstitions invest them, that in some
royal instances even to idiot imbecility they have imparted potency.
But when, as in the case of Nicholas the Czar, the ringed crown of
geographical empire encircles an imperial brain; then, the plebeian
herds crouch abased before the tremendous centralization.  Nor, will
the tragic dramatist who would depict mortal indomitableness in its
fullest sweep and direct swing, ever forget a hint, incidentally so
important in his art, as the one now alluded to.

But Ahab, my Captain, still moves before me in all his Nantucket
grimness and shagginess; and in this episode touching Emperors and
Kings, I must not conceal that I have only to do with a poor old
whale-hunter like him; and, therefore, all outward majestical
trappings and housings are denied me.  Oh, Ahab! what shall be grand
in thee, it must needs be plucked at from the skies, and dived for in
the deep, and featured in the unbodied air!



CHAPTER 34

The Cabin-Table.


It is noon; and Dough-Boy, the steward, thrusting his pale
loaf-of-bread face from the cabin-scuttle, announces dinner to his
lord and master; who, sitting in the lee quarter-boat, has just been
taking an observation of the sun; and is now mutely reckoning the
latitude on the smooth, medallion-shaped tablet, reserved for that
daily purpose on the upper part of his ivory leg.  From his complete
inattention to the tidings, you would think that moody Ahab had not
heard his menial.  But presently, catching hold of the mizen shrouds,
he swings himself to the deck, and in an even, unexhilarated voice,
saying, Dinner, Mr. Starbuck, disappears into the cabin.

When the last echo of his sultan's step has died away, and Starbuck,
the first Emir, has every reason to suppose that he is seated, then
Starbuck rouses from his quietude, takes a few turns along the
planks, and, after a grave peep into the binnacle, says, with some
touch of pleasantness, Dinner, Mr. Stubb, and descends the scuttle.
The second Emir lounges about the rigging awhile, and then slightly
shaking the main brace, to see whether it will be all right with
that important rope, he likewise takes up the old burden, and with a
rapid Dinner, Mr. Flask, follows after his predecessors.

But the third Emir, now seeing himself all alone on the quarter-deck,
seems to feel relieved from some curious restraint; for, tipping all
sorts of knowing winks in all sorts of directions, and kicking off
his shoes, he strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe
right over the Grand Turk's head; and then, by a dexterous sleight,
pitching his cap up into the mizentop for a shelf, he goes down
rollicking so far at least as he remains visible from the deck,
reversing all other processions, by bringing up the rear with music.
But ere stepping into the cabin doorway below, he pauses, ships a new
face altogether, and, then, independent, hilarious little Flask
enters King Ahab's presence, in the character of Abjectus, or the
Slave.

It is not the least among the strange things bred by the intense
artificialness of sea-usages, that while in the open air of the deck
some officers will, upon provocation, bear themselves boldly and
defyingly enough towards their commander; yet, ten to one, let those
very officers the next moment go down to their customary dinner in
that same commander's cabin, and straightway their inoffensive, not
to say deprecatory and humble air towards him, as he sits at the head
of the table; this is marvellous, sometimes most comical.  Wherefore
this difference?  A problem?  Perhaps not.  To have been Belshazzar,
King of Babylon; and to have been Belshazzar, not haughtily but
courteously, therein certainly must have been some touch of mundane
grandeur.  But he who in the rightly regal and intelligent spirit
presides over his own private dinner-table of invited guests, that
man's unchallenged power and dominion of individual influence for the
time; that man's royalty of state transcends Belshazzar's, for
Belshazzar was not the greatest.  Who has but once dined his friends,
has tasted what it is to be Caesar.  It is a witchery of social
czarship which there is no withstanding.  Now, if to this
consideration you superadd the official supremacy of a ship-master,
then, by inference, you will derive the cause of that peculiarity of
sea-life just mentioned.

Over his ivory-inlaid table, Ahab presided like a mute, maned
sea-lion on the white coral beach, surrounded by his warlike but
still deferential cubs.  In his own proper turn, each officer waited
to be served.  They were as little children before Ahab; and yet, in
Ahab, there seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance.  With
one mind, their intent eyes all fastened upon the old man's knife, as
he carved the chief dish before him.  I do not suppose that for the
world they would have profaned that moment with the slightest
observation, even upon so neutral a topic as the weather.  No!  And
when reaching out his knife and fork, between which the slice of beef
was locked, Ahab thereby motioned Starbuck's plate towards him, the
mate received his meat as though receiving alms; and cut it tenderly;
and a little started if, perchance, the knife grazed against the
plate; and chewed it noiselessly; and swallowed it, not without
circumspection.  For, like the Coronation banquet at Frankfort, where
the German Emperor profoundly dines with the seven Imperial
Electors, so these cabin meals were somehow solemn meals, eaten in
awful silence; and yet at table old Ahab forbade not conversation;
only he himself was dumb.  What a relief it was to choking Stubb,
when a rat made a sudden racket in the hold below.  And poor little
Flask, he was the youngest son, and little boy of this weary family
party.  His were the shinbones of the saline beef; his would have
been the drumsticks.  For Flask to have presumed to help himself,
this must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the first
degree.  Had he helped himself at that table, doubtless, never more
would he have been able to hold his head up in this honest world;
nevertheless, strange to say, Ahab never forbade him.  And had Flask
helped himself, the chances were Ahab had never so much as noticed
it.  Least of all, did Flask presume to help himself to butter.
Whether he thought the owners of the ship denied it to him, on
account of its clotting his clear, sunny complexion; or whether he
deemed that, on so long a voyage in such marketless waters, butter
was at a premium, and therefore was not for him, a subaltern; however
it was, Flask, alas! was a butterless man!

Another thing.  Flask was the last person down at the dinner, and
Flask is the first man up.  Consider!  For hereby Flask's dinner was
badly jammed in point of time.  Starbuck and Stubb both had the start
of him; and yet they also have the privilege of lounging in the rear.
If Stubb even, who is but a peg higher than Flask, happens to have
but a small appetite, and soon shows symptoms of concluding his
repast, then Flask must bestir himself, he will not get more than
three mouthfuls that day; for it is against holy usage for Stubb to
precede Flask to the deck.  Therefore it was that Flask once admitted
in private, that ever since he had arisen to the dignity of an
officer, from that moment he had never known what it was to be
otherwise than hungry, more or less.  For what he ate did not so much
relieve his hunger, as keep it immortal in him.  Peace and
satisfaction, thought Flask, have for ever departed from my stomach.
I am an officer; but, how I wish I could fish a bit of old-fashioned
beef in the forecastle, as I used to when I was before the mast.
There's the fruits of promotion now; there's the vanity of glory:
there's the insanity of life!  Besides, if it were so that any mere
sailor of the Pequod had a grudge against Flask in Flask's official
capacity, all that sailor had to do, in order to obtain ample
vengeance, was to go aft at dinner-time, and get a peep at Flask
through the cabin sky-light, sitting silly and dumfoundered before
awful Ahab.

Now, Ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first
table in the Pequod's cabin.  After their departure, taking place in
inverted order to their arrival, the canvas cloth was cleared, or
rather was restored to some hurried order by the pallid steward.  And
then the three harpooneers were bidden to the feast, they being its
residuary legatees.  They made a sort of temporary servants' hall of
the high and mighty cabin.

In strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless
invisible domineerings of the captain's table, was the entire
care-free license and ease, the almost frantic democracy of those
inferior fellows the harpooneers.  While their masters, the mates,
seemed afraid of the sound of the hinges of their own jaws, the
harpooneers chewed their food with such a relish that there was a
report to it.  They dined like lords; they filled their bellies like
Indian ships all day loading with spices.  Such portentous appetites
had Queequeg and Tashtego, that to fill out the vacancies made by the
previous repast, often the pale Dough-Boy was fain to bring on a
great baron of salt-junk, seemingly quarried out of the solid ox.
And if he were not lively about it, if he did not go with a nimble
hop-skip-and-jump, then Tashtego had an ungentlemanly way of
accelerating him by darting a fork at his back, harpoon-wise.  And
once Daggoo, seized with a sudden humor, assisted Dough-Boy's memory
by snatching him up bodily, and thrusting his head into a great empty
wooden trencher, while Tashtego, knife in hand, began laying out the
circle preliminary to scalping him.  He was naturally a very nervous,
shuddering sort of little fellow, this bread-faced steward; the
progeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospital nurse.  And what with the
standing spectacle of the black terrific Ahab, and the periodical
tumultuous visitations of these three savages, Dough-Boy's whole life
was one continual lip-quiver.  Commonly, after seeing the harpooneers
furnished with all things they demanded, he would escape from their
clutches into his little pantry adjoining, and fearfully peep out at
them through the blinds of its door, till all was over.

It was a sight to see Queequeg seated over against Tashtego, opposing
his filed teeth to the Indian's: crosswise to them, Daggoo seated on
the floor, for a bench would have brought his hearse-plumed head to
the low carlines; at every motion of his colossal limbs, making the
low cabin framework to shake, as when an African elephant goes
passenger in a ship.  But for all this, the great negro was
wonderfully abstemious, not to say dainty.  It seemed hardly possible
that by such comparatively small mouthfuls he could keep up the
vitality diffused through so broad, baronial, and superb a person.
But, doubtless, this noble savage fed strong and drank deep of the
abounding element of air; and through his dilated nostrils snuffed in
the sublime life of the worlds.  Not by beef or by bread, are giants
made or nourished.  But Queequeg, he had a mortal, barbaric smack of
the lip in eating--an ugly sound enough--so much so, that the
trembling Dough-Boy almost looked to see whether any marks of teeth
lurked in his own lean arms.  And when he would hear Tashtego singing
out for him to produce himself, that his bones might be picked, the
simple-witted steward all but shattered the crockery hanging round
him in the pantry, by his sudden fits of the palsy.  Nor did the
whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets, for their
lances and other weapons; and with which whetstones, at dinner, they
would ostentatiously sharpen their knives; that grating sound did not
at all tend to tranquillize poor Dough-Boy.  How could he forget that
in his Island days, Queequeg, for one, must certainly have been
guilty of some murderous, convivial indiscretions.  Alas!  Dough-Boy!
hard fares the white waiter who waits upon cannibals.  Not a napkin
should he carry on his arm, but a buckler.  In good time, though, to
his great delight, the three salt-sea warriors would rise and depart;
to his credulous, fable-mongering ears, all their martial bones
jingling in them at every step, like Moorish scimetars in scabbards.

But, though these barbarians dined in the cabin, and nominally lived
there; still, being anything but sedentary in their habits, they were
scarcely ever in it except at mealtimes, and just before
sleeping-time, when they passed through it to their own peculiar
quarters.

In this one matter, Ahab seemed no exception to most American whale
captains, who, as a set, rather incline to the opinion that by rights
the ship's cabin belongs to them; and that it is by courtesy alone
that anybody else is, at any time, permitted there.  So that, in real
truth, the mates and harpooneers of the Pequod might more properly be
said to have lived out of the cabin than in it.  For when they did
enter it, it was something as a street-door enters a house; turning
inwards for a moment, only to be turned out the next; and, as a
permanent thing, residing in the open air.  Nor did they lose much
hereby; in the cabin was no companionship; socially, Ahab was
inaccessible.  Though nominally included in the census of
Christendom, he was still an alien to it.  He lived in the world, as
the last of the Grisly Bears lived in settled Missouri.  And as when
Spring and Summer had departed, that wild Logan of the woods, burying
himself in the hollow of a tree, lived out the winter there, sucking
his own paws; so, in his inclement, howling old age, Ahab's soul,
shut up in the caved trunk of his body, there fed upon the sullen
paws of its gloom!



CHAPTER 35

The Mast-Head.


It was during the more pleasant weather, that in due rotation with
the other seamen my first mast-head came round.

In most American whalemen the mast-heads are manned almost
simultaneously with the vessel's leaving her port; even though she
may have fifteen thousand miles, and more, to sail ere reaching her
proper cruising ground.  And if, after a three, four, or five years'
voyage she is drawing nigh home with anything empty in her--say, an
empty vial even--then, her mast-heads are kept manned to the last;
and not till her skysail-poles sail in among the spires of the port,
does she altogether relinquish the hope of capturing one whale more.

Now, as the business of standing mast-heads, ashore or afloat, is a
very ancient and interesting one, let us in some measure expatiate
here.  I take it, that the earliest standers of mast-heads were the
old Egyptians; because, in all my researches, I find none prior to
them.  For though their progenitors, the builders of Babel, must
doubtless, by their tower, have intended to rear the loftiest
mast-head in all Asia, or Africa either; yet (ere the final truck was
put to it) as that great stone mast of theirs may be said to have
gone by the board, in the dread gale of God's wrath; therefore, we
cannot give these Babel builders priority over the Egyptians.  And
that the Egyptians were a nation of mast-head standers, is an
assertion based upon the general belief among archaeologists, that
the first pyramids were founded for astronomical purposes: a theory
singularly supported by the peculiar stair-like formation of all four
sides of those edifices; whereby, with prodigious long upliftings of
their legs, those old astronomers were wont to mount to the apex, and
sing out for new stars; even as the look-outs of a modern ship sing
out for a sail, or a whale just bearing in sight.  In Saint Stylites,
the famous Christian hermit of old times, who built him a lofty stone
pillar in the desert and spent the whole latter portion of his life
on its summit, hoisting his food from the ground with a tackle; in
him we have a remarkable instance of a dauntless
stander-of-mast-heads; who was not to be driven from his place by
fogs or frosts, rain, hail, or sleet; but valiantly facing everything
out to the last, literally died at his post.  Of modern
standers-of-mast-heads we have but a lifeless set; mere stone, iron,
and bronze men; who, though well capable of facing out a stiff gale,
are still entirely incompetent to the business of singing out upon
discovering any strange sight.  There is Napoleon; who, upon the top
of the column of Vendome, stands with arms folded, some one hundred
and fifty feet in the air; careless, now, who rules the decks below;
whether Louis Philippe, Louis Blanc, or Louis the Devil.  Great
Washington, too, stands high aloft on his towering main-mast in
Baltimore, and like one of Hercules' pillars, his column marks that
point of human grandeur beyond which few mortals will go.  Admiral
Nelson, also, on a capstan of gun-metal, stands his mast-head in
Trafalgar Square; and ever when most obscured by that London smoke,
token is yet given that a hidden hero is there; for where there is
smoke, must be fire.  But neither great Washington, nor Napoleon, nor
Nelson, will answer a single hail from below, however madly invoked
to befriend by their counsels the distracted decks upon which they
gaze; however it may be surmised, that their spirits penetrate
through the thick haze of the future, and descry what shoals and what
rocks must be shunned.

It may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast-head
standers of the land with those of the sea; but that in truth it is
not so, is plainly evinced by an item for which Obed Macy, the sole
historian of Nantucket, stands accountable.  The worthy Obed tells
us, that in the early times of the whale fishery, ere ships were
regularly launched in pursuit of the game, the people of that island
erected lofty spars along the sea-coast, to which the look-outs
ascended by means of nailed cleats, something as fowls go upstairs in
a hen-house.  A few years ago this same plan was adopted by the Bay
whalemen of New Zealand, who, upon descrying the game, gave notice to
the ready-manned boats nigh the beach.  But this custom has now
become obsolete; turn we then to the one proper mast-head, that of a
whale-ship at sea.  The three mast-heads are kept manned from
sun-rise to sun-set; the seamen taking their regular turns (as at the
helm), and relieving each other every two hours.  In the serene
weather of the tropics it is exceedingly pleasant the mast-head; nay,
to a dreamy meditative man it is delightful.  There you stand, a
hundred feet above the silent decks, striding along the deep, as if
the masts were gigantic stilts, while beneath you and between your
legs, as it were, swim the hugest monsters of the sea, even as ships
once sailed between the boots of the famous Colossus at old Rhodes.
There you stand, lost in the infinite series of the sea, with nothing
ruffled but the waves.  The tranced ship indolently rolls; the drowsy
trade winds blow; everything resolves you into languor.  For the most
part, in this tropic whaling life, a sublime uneventfulness invests
you; you hear no news; read no gazettes; extras with startling
accounts of commonplaces never delude you into unnecessary
excitements; you hear of no domestic afflictions; bankrupt
securities; fall of stocks; are never troubled with the thought of
what you shall have for dinner--for all your meals for three years
and more are snugly stowed in casks, and your bill of fare is
immutable.

In one of those southern whalesmen, on a long three or four years'
voyage, as often happens, the sum of the various hours you spend at
the mast-head would amount to several entire months.  And it is much
to be deplored that the place to which you devote so considerable a
portion of the whole term of your natural life, should be so sadly
destitute of anything approaching to a cosy inhabitiveness, or
adapted to breed a comfortable localness of feeling, such as pertains
to a bed, a hammock, a hearse, a sentry box, a pulpit, a coach, or
any other of those small and snug contrivances in which men
temporarily isolate themselves.  Your most usual point of perch is
the head of the t' gallant-mast, where you stand upon two thin
parallel sticks (almost peculiar to whalemen) called the t' gallant
cross-trees.  Here, tossed about by the sea, the beginner feels about
as cosy as he would standing on a bull's horns.  To be sure, in cold
weather you may carry your house aloft with you, in the shape of a
watch-coat; but properly speaking the thickest watch-coat is no more
of a house than the unclad body; for as the soul is glued inside of
its fleshy tabernacle, and cannot freely move about in it, nor even
move out of it, without running great risk of perishing (like an
ignorant pilgrim crossing the snowy Alps in winter); so a watch-coat
is not so much of a house as it is a mere envelope, or additional
skin encasing you.  You cannot put a shelf or chest of drawers in
your body, and no more can you make a convenient closet of your
watch-coat.

Concerning all this, it is much to be deplored that the mast-heads of
a southern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents
or pulpits, called CROW'S-NESTS, in which the look-outs of a
Greenland whaler are protected from the inclement weather of the
frozen seas.  In the fireside narrative of Captain Sleet, entitled
A Voyage among the Icebergs, in quest of the Greenland Whale, and"
3247	incidentally for the re-discovery of the Lost Icelandic Colonies of
3248	"Old Greenland; in this admirable volume, all standers of mast-heads
are furnished with a charmingly circumstantial account of the then
recently invented CROW'S-NEST of the Glacier, which was the name of
Captain Sleet's good craft.  He called it the SLEET'S CROW'S-NEST, in
honour of himself; he being the original inventor and patentee, and
free from all ridiculous false delicacy, and holding that if we call
our own children after our own names (we fathers being the original
inventors and patentees), so likewise should we denominate after
ourselves any other apparatus we may beget.  In shape, the Sleet's
crow's-nest is something like a large tierce or pipe; it is open
above, however, where it is furnished with a movable side-screen to
keep to windward of your head in a hard gale.  Being fixed on the
summit of the mast, you ascend into it through a little trap-hatch in
the bottom.  On the after side, or side next the stern of the ship,
is a comfortable seat, with a locker underneath for umbrellas,
comforters, and coats.  In front is a leather rack, in which to keep
your speaking trumpet, pipe, telescope, and other nautical
conveniences.  When Captain Sleet in person stood his mast-head in
this crow's-nest of his, he tells us that he always had a rifle with
him (also fixed in the rack), together with a powder flask and shot,
for the purpose of popping off the stray narwhales, or vagrant sea
unicorns infesting those waters; for you cannot successfully shoot at
them from the deck owing to the resistance of the water, but to shoot
down upon them is a very different thing.  Now, it was plainly a
labor of love for Captain Sleet to describe, as he does, all the
little detailed conveniences of his crow's-nest; but though he so
enlarges upon many of these, and though he treats us to a very
scientific account of his experiments in this crow's-nest, with a
small compass he kept there for the purpose of counteracting the
errors resulting from what is called the local attraction of all
binnacle magnets; an error ascribable to the horizontal vicinity of
the iron in the ship's planks, and in the Glacier's case, perhaps, to
there having been so many broken-down blacksmiths among her crew; I
say, that though the Captain is very discreet and scientific here,
yet, for all his learned binnacle deviations, azimuth compass"
3249	"observations, and approximate errors, he knows very well, Captain
Sleet, that he was not so much immersed in those profound magnetic
meditations, as to fail being attracted occasionally towards that
well replenished little case-bottle, so nicely tucked in on one side
of his crow's nest, within easy reach of his hand.  Though, upon the
whole, I greatly admire and even love the brave, the honest, and
learned Captain; yet I take it very ill of him that he should so
utterly ignore that case-bottle, seeing what a faithful friend and
comforter it must have been, while with mittened fingers and hooded
head he was studying the mathematics aloft there in that bird's nest
within three or four perches of the pole.

But if we Southern whale-fishers are not so snugly housed aloft as
Captain Sleet and his Greenlandmen were; yet that disadvantage is
greatly counter-balanced by the widely contrasting serenity of those
seductive seas in which we South fishers mostly float.  For one, I
used to lounge up the rigging very leisurely, resting in the top to
have a chat with Queequeg, or any one else off duty whom I might find
there; then ascending a little way further, and throwing a lazy leg
over the top-sail yard, take a preliminary view of the watery
pastures, and so at last mount to my ultimate destination.

Let me make a clean breast of it here, and frankly admit that I kept
but sorry guard.  With the problem of the universe revolving in me,
how could I--being left completely to myself at such a
thought-engendering altitude--how could I but lightly hold my
obligations to observe all whale-ships' standing orders, Keep your"
3250	"weather eye open, and sing out every time.

And let me in this place movingly admonish you, ye ship-owners of
Nantucket!  Beware of enlisting in your vigilant fisheries any lad
with lean brow and hollow eye; given to unseasonable meditativeness;
and who offers to ship with the Phaedon instead of Bowditch in his
head.  Beware of such an one, I say; your whales must be seen before
they can be killed; and this sunken-eyed young Platonist will tow you
ten wakes round the world, and never make you one pint of sperm the
richer.  Nor are these monitions at all unneeded.  For nowadays, the
whale-fishery furnishes an asylum for many romantic, melancholy, and
absent-minded young men, disgusted with the carking cares of earth,
and seeking sentiment in tar and blubber.  Childe Harold not
unfrequently perches himself upon the mast-head of some luckless
disappointed whale-ship, and in moody phrase ejaculates:--

Roll on, thou deep and dark blue ocean, roll!  Ten thousand"
3251	"blubber-hunters sweep over thee in vain.

Very often do the captains of such ships take those absent-minded
young philosophers to task, upbraiding them with not feeling
sufficient interest in the voyage; half-hinting that they are so
hopelessly lost to all honourable ambition, as that in their secret
souls they would rather not see whales than otherwise.  But all in
vain; those young Platonists have a notion that their vision is
imperfect; they are short-sighted; what use, then, to strain the
visual nerve?  They have left their opera-glasses at home.

Why, thou monkey, said a harpooneer to one of these lads, we've"
3252	been cruising now hard upon three years, and thou hast not raised a
3253	whale yet.  Whales are scarce as hen's teeth whenever thou art up
3254	"here.  Perhaps they were; or perhaps there might have been shoals of
them in the far horizon; but lulled into such an opium-like
listlessness of vacant, unconscious reverie is this absent-minded
youth by the blending cadence of waves with thoughts, that at last he
loses his identity; takes the mystic ocean at his feet for the
visible image of that deep, blue, bottomless soul, pervading mankind
and nature; and every strange, half-seen, gliding, beautiful thing
that eludes him; every dimly-discovered, uprising fin of some
undiscernible form, seems to him the embodiment of those elusive
thoughts that only people the soul by continually flitting through
it.  In this enchanted mood, thy spirit ebbs away to whence it came;
becomes diffused through time and space; like Crammer's sprinkled
Pantheistic ashes, forming at last a part of every shore the round
globe over.

There is no life in thee, now, except that rocking life imparted by a
gently rolling ship; by her, borrowed from the sea; by the sea, from
the inscrutable tides of God.  But while this sleep, this dream is on
ye, move your foot or hand an inch; slip your hold at all; and your
identity comes back in horror.  Over Descartian vortices you hover.
And perhaps, at mid-day, in the fairest weather, with one
half-throttled shriek you drop through that transparent air into the
summer sea, no more to rise for ever.  Heed it well, ye Pantheists!



CHAPTER 36

The Quarter-Deck.


(ENTER AHAB: THEN, ALL)


It was not a great while after the affair of the pipe, that one
morning shortly after breakfast, Ahab, as was his wont, ascended the
cabin-gangway to the deck.  There most sea-captains usually walk at
that hour, as country gentlemen, after the same meal, take a few
turns in the garden.

Soon his steady, ivory stride was heard, as to and fro he paced his
old rounds, upon planks so familiar to his tread, that they were all
over dented, like geological stones, with the peculiar mark of his
walk.  Did you fixedly gaze, too, upon that ribbed and dented brow;
there also, you would see still stranger foot-prints--the foot-prints
of his one unsleeping, ever-pacing thought.

But on the occasion in question, those dents looked deeper, even as
his nervous step that morning left a deeper mark.  And, so full of
his thought was Ahab, that at every uniform turn that he made, now at
the main-mast and now at the binnacle, you could almost see that
thought turn in him as he turned, and pace in him as he paced; so
completely possessing him, indeed, that it all but seemed the inward
mould of every outer movement.

D'ye mark him, Flask? whispered Stubb; the chick that's in him"
3255	"pecks the shell.  'Twill soon be out.

The hours wore on;--Ahab now shut up within his cabin; anon, pacing
the deck, with the same intense bigotry of purpose in his aspect.

It drew near the close of day.  Suddenly he came to a halt by the
bulwarks, and inserting his bone leg into the auger-hole there, and
with one hand grasping a shroud, he ordered Starbuck to send
everybody aft.

Sir! said the mate, astonished at an order seldom or never given on
ship-board except in some extraordinary case.

Send everybody aft, repeated Ahab.  Mast-heads, there! come down!

When the entire ship's company were assembled, and with curious and
not wholly unapprehensive faces, were eyeing him, for he looked not
unlike the weather horizon when a storm is coming up, Ahab, after
rapidly glancing over the bulwarks, and then darting his eyes among
the crew, started from his standpoint; and as though not a soul were
nigh him resumed his heavy turns upon the deck.  With bent head and
half-slouched hat he continued to pace, unmindful of the wondering
whispering among the men; till Stubb cautiously whispered to Flask,
that Ahab must have summoned them there for the purpose of witnessing
a pedestrian feat.  But this did not last long.  Vehemently pausing,
he cried:--

What do ye do when ye see a whale, men?

Sing out for him! was the impulsive rejoinder from a score of
clubbed voices.

Good! cried Ahab, with a wild approval in his tones; observing the
hearty animation into which his unexpected question had so
magnetically thrown them.

And what do ye next, men?

Lower away, and after him!

And what tune is it ye pull to, men?

A dead whale or a stove boat!

More and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving, grew the
countenance of the old man at every shout; while the mariners began
to gaze curiously at each other, as if marvelling how it was that
they themselves became so excited at such seemingly purposeless
questions.

But, they were all eagerness again, as Ahab, now half-revolving in
his pivot-hole, with one hand reaching high up a shroud, and tightly,
almost convulsively grasping it, addressed them thus:--

All ye mast-headers have before now heard me give orders about a"
3256	"white whale.  Look ye! d'ye see this Spanish ounce of gold?--holding
up a broad bright coin to the sun--it is a sixteen dollar piece,"
3257	"men.  D'ye see it?  Mr. Starbuck, hand me yon top-maul.

While the mate was getting the hammer, Ahab, without speaking, was
slowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket, as if
to heighten its lustre, and without using any words was meanwhile
lowly humming to himself, producing a sound so strangely muffled and
inarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of
his vitality in him.

Receiving the top-maul from Starbuck, he advanced towards the
main-mast with the hammer uplifted in one hand, exhibiting the gold
with the other, and with a high raised voice exclaiming: Whosoever"
3258	of ye raises me a white-headed whale with a wrinkled brow and a
3259	crooked jaw; whosoever of ye raises me that white-headed whale, with
3260	three holes punctured in his starboard fluke--look ye, whosoever of
3261	ye raises me that same white whale, he shall have this gold ounce, my
3262	"boys!

Huzza! huzza! cried the seamen, as with swinging tarpaulins they
hailed the act of nailing the gold to the mast.

It's a white whale, I say, resumed Ahab, as he threw down the
topmaul: a white whale.  Skin your eyes for him, men; look sharp for"
3263	"white water; if ye see but a bubble, sing out.

All this while Tashtego, Daggoo, and Queequeg had looked on with even
more intense interest and surprise than the rest, and at the mention
of the wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they had started as if each was
separately touched by some specific recollection.

Captain Ahab, said Tashtego, that white whale must be the same"
3264	"that some call Moby Dick.

Moby Dick? shouted Ahab.  Do ye know the white whale then, Tash?

Does he fan-tail a little curious, sir, before he goes down? said
the Gay-Header deliberately.

And has he a curious spout, too, said Daggoo, very bushy, even for"
3265	"a parmacetty, and mighty quick, Captain Ahab?

And he have one, two, three--oh! good many iron in him hide, too,"
3266	Captain, cried Queequeg disjointedly, all twiske-tee be-twisk, like
3267	"him--him-- faltering hard for a word, and screwing his hand round
and round as though uncorking a bottle--like him--him--

Corkscrew! cried Ahab, aye, Queequeg, the harpoons lie all twisted"
3268	and wrenched in him; aye, Daggoo, his spout is a big one, like a
3269	whole shock of wheat, and white as a pile of our Nantucket wool after
3270	the great annual sheep-shearing; aye, Tashtego, and he fan-tails like
3271	a split jib in a squall.  Death and devils! men, it is Moby Dick ye
3272	"have seen--Moby Dick--Moby Dick!

Captain Ahab, said Starbuck, who, with Stubb and Flask, had thus
far been eyeing his superior with increasing surprise, but at last
seemed struck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder.
Captain Ahab, I have heard of Moby Dick--but it was not Moby Dick"
3273	"that took off thy leg?

Who told thee that? cried Ahab; then pausing, Aye, Starbuck; aye,"
3274	my hearties all round; it was Moby Dick that dismasted me; Moby Dick
3275	"that brought me to this dead stump I stand on now.  Aye, aye, he
shouted with a terrific, loud, animal sob, like that of a
heart-stricken moose; Aye, aye! it was that accursed white whale"
3276	"that razeed me; made a poor pegging lubber of me for ever and a day!
Then tossing both arms, with measureless imprecations he shouted
out: Aye, aye! and I'll chase him round Good Hope, and round the"
3277	Horn, and round the Norway Maelstrom, and round perdition's flames
3278	before I give him up.  And this is what ye have shipped for, men! to
3279	chase that white whale on both sides of land, and over all sides of
3280	earth, till he spouts black blood and rolls fin out.  What say ye,
3281	"men, will ye splice hands on it, now?  I think ye do look brave.

Aye, aye! shouted the harpooneers and seamen, running closer to the
excited old man: A sharp eye for the white whale; a sharp lance for"
3282	"Moby Dick!

God bless ye, he seemed to half sob and half shout.  God bless ye,"
3283	men.  Steward! go draw the great measure of grog.  But what's this
3284	long face about, Mr. Starbuck; wilt thou not chase the white whale?
3285	"art not game for Moby Dick?

I am game for his crooked jaw, and for the jaws of Death too,"
3286	Captain Ahab, if it fairly comes in the way of the business we
3287	follow; but I came here to hunt whales, not my commander's vengeance.
3288	How many barrels will thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest
3289	it, Captain Ahab? it will not fetch thee much in our Nantucket
3290	"market.

Nantucket market!  Hoot!  But come closer, Starbuck; thou requirest"
3291	a little lower layer.  If money's to be the measurer, man, and the
3292	accountants have computed their great counting-house the globe, by
3293	girdling it with guineas, one to every three parts of an inch; then,
3294	"let me tell thee, that my vengeance will fetch a great premium HERE!

He smites his chest, whispered Stubb, what's that for? methinks it"
3295	"rings most vast, but hollow.

Vengeance on a dumb brute! cried Starbuck, that simply smote thee"
3296	from blindest instinct!  Madness!  To be enraged with a dumb thing,
3297	"Captain Ahab, seems blasphemous.

Hark ye yet again--the little lower layer.  All visible objects,"
3298	man, are but as pasteboard masks.  But in each event--in the living
3299	act, the undoubted deed--there, some unknown but still reasoning
3300	thing puts forth the mouldings of its features from behind the
3301	unreasoning mask.  If man will strike, strike through the mask!  How
3302	can the prisoner reach outside except by thrusting through the wall?
3303	To me, the white whale is that wall, shoved near to me.  Sometimes I
3304	think there's naught beyond.  But 'tis enough.  He tasks me; he heaps
3305	me; I see in him outrageous strength, with an inscrutable malice
3306	sinewing it.  That inscrutable thing is chiefly what I hate; and be
3307	the white whale agent, or be the white whale principal, I will wreak
3308	that hate upon him.  Talk not to me of blasphemy, man; I'd strike the
3309	sun if it insulted me.  For could the sun do that, then could I do
3310	the other; since there is ever a sort of fair play herein, jealousy
3311	presiding over all creations.  But not my master, man, is even that
3312	fair play.  Who's over me?  Truth hath no confines.  Take off thine
3313	eye! more intolerable than fiends' glarings is a doltish stare!  So,
3314	so; thou reddenest and palest; my heat has melted thee to anger-glow.
3315	But look ye, Starbuck, what is said in heat, that thing unsays
3316	itself.  There are men from whom warm words are small indignity.  I
3317	meant not to incense thee.  Let it go.  Look! see yonder Turkish
3318	cheeks of spotted tawn--living, breathing pictures painted by the
3319	sun.  The Pagan leopards--the unrecking and unworshipping things,
3320	that live; and seek, and give no reasons for the torrid life they
3321	feel!  The crew, man, the crew!  Are they not one and all with Ahab,
3322	in this matter of the whale?  See Stubb! he laughs!  See yonder
3323	Chilian! he snorts to think of it.  Stand up amid the general
3324	hurricane, thy one tost sapling cannot, Starbuck!  And what is it?
3325	Reckon it.  'Tis but to help strike a fin; no wondrous feat for
3326	Starbuck.  What is it more?  From this one poor hunt, then, the best
3327	lance out of all Nantucket, surely he will not hang back, when every
3328	foremast-hand has clutched a whetstone?  Ah! constrainings seize
3329	thee; I see! the billow lifts thee!  Speak, but speak!--Aye, aye! thy
3330	silence, then, THAT voices thee.  (ASIDE) Something shot from my
3331	dilated nostrils, he has inhaled it in his lungs.  Starbuck now is
3332	"mine; cannot oppose me now, without rebellion.

God keep me!--keep us all! murmured Starbuck, lowly.

But in his joy at the enchanted, tacit acquiescence of the mate, Ahab
did not hear his foreboding invocation; nor yet the low laugh from
the hold; nor yet the presaging vibrations of the winds in the
cordage; nor yet the hollow flap of the sails against the masts, as
for a moment their hearts sank in.  For again Starbuck's downcast
eyes lighted up with the stubbornness of life; the subterranean laugh
died away; the winds blew on; the sails filled out; the ship heaved
and rolled as before.  Ah, ye admonitions and warnings! why stay ye
not when ye come?  But rather are ye predictions than warnings, ye
shadows!  Yet not so much predictions from without, as verifications
of the foregoing things within.  For with little external to
constrain us, the innermost necessities in our being, these still
drive us on.

The measure! the measure! cried Ahab.

Receiving the brimming pewter, and turning to the harpooneers, he
ordered them to produce their weapons.  Then ranging them before him
near the capstan, with their harpoons in their hands, while his three
mates stood at his side with their lances, and the rest of the ship's
company formed a circle round the group; he stood for an instant
searchingly eyeing every man of his crew.  But those wild eyes met
his, as the bloodshot eyes of the prairie wolves meet the eye of
their leader, ere he rushes on at their head in the trail of the
bison; but, alas! only to fall into the hidden snare of the Indian.

Drink and pass! he cried, handing the heavy charged flagon to the
nearest seaman.  The crew alone now drink.  Round with it, round!"
3333	Short draughts--long swallows, men; 'tis hot as Satan's hoof.  So,
3334	so; it goes round excellently.  It spiralizes in ye; forks out at the
3335	serpent-snapping eye.  Well done; almost drained.  That way it went,
3336	this way it comes.  Hand it me--here's a hollow!  Men, ye seem the
3337	years; so brimming life is gulped and gone.  Steward, refill!
3338	
3339	"Attend now, my braves.  I have mustered ye all round this capstan;
and ye mates, flank me with your lances; and ye harpooneers, stand
there with your irons; and ye, stout mariners, ring me in, that I may
in some sort revive a noble custom of my fisherman fathers before
me.  O men, you will yet see that--Ha! boy, come back? bad pennies
come not sooner.  Hand it me.  Why, now, this pewter had run brimming
again, were't not thou St. Vitus' imp--away, thou ague!

Advance, ye mates!  Cross your lances full before me.  Well done!"
3340	"Let me touch the axis.  So saying, with extended arm, he grasped the
three level, radiating lances at their crossed centre; while so
doing, suddenly and nervously twitched them; meanwhile, glancing
intently from Starbuck to Stubb; from Stubb to Flask.  It seemed as
though, by some nameless, interior volition, he would fain have
shocked into them the same fiery emotion accumulated within the
Leyden jar of his own magnetic life.  The three mates quailed before
his strong, sustained, and mystic aspect.  Stubb and Flask looked
sideways from him; the honest eye of Starbuck fell downright.

In vain! cried Ahab; but, maybe, 'tis well.  For did ye three but"
3341	once take the full-forced shock, then mine own electric thing, THAT
3342	had perhaps expired from out me.  Perchance, too, it would have
3343	dropped ye dead.  Perchance ye need it not.  Down lances!  And now,
3344	ye mates, I do appoint ye three cupbearers to my three pagan kinsmen
3345	there--yon three most honourable gentlemen and noblemen, my valiant
3346	harpooneers.  Disdain the task?  What, when the great Pope washes the
3347	feet of beggars, using his tiara for ewer?  Oh, my sweet cardinals!
3348	your own condescension, THAT shall bend ye to it.  I do not order ye;
3349	"ye will it.  Cut your seizings and draw the poles, ye harpooneers!

Silently obeying the order, the three harpooneers now stood with the
detached iron part of their harpoons, some three feet long, held,
barbs up, before him.

Stab me not with that keen steel!  Cant them; cant them over! know"
3350	ye not the goblet end?  Turn up the socket!  So, so; now, ye
3351	"cup-bearers, advance.  The irons! take them; hold them while I fill!
Forthwith, slowly going from one officer to the other, he brimmed
the harpoon sockets with the fiery waters from the pewter.

Now, three to three, ye stand.  Commend the murderous chalices!"
3352	Bestow them, ye who are now made parties to this indissoluble league.
3353	Ha!  Starbuck! but the deed is done!  Yon ratifying sun now waits to
3354	sit upon it.  Drink, ye harpooneers! drink and swear, ye men that man
3355	the deathful whaleboat's bow--Death to Moby Dick!  God hunt us all,
3356	"if we do not hunt Moby Dick to his death!  The long, barbed steel
goblets were lifted; and to cries and maledictions against the white
whale, the spirits were simultaneously quaffed down with a hiss.
Starbuck paled, and turned, and shivered.  Once more, and finally,
the replenished pewter went the rounds among the frantic crew; when,
waving his free hand to them, they all dispersed; and Ahab retired
within his cabin.



CHAPTER 37

Sunset.


THE CABIN; BY THE STERN WINDOWS; AHAB SITTING ALONE, AND GAZING OUT.


I leave a white and turbid wake; pale waters, paler cheeks, where'er
I sail.  The envious billows sidelong swell to whelm my track; let
them; but first I pass.

Yonder, by ever-brimming goblet's rim, the warm waves blush like
wine.  The gold brow plumbs the blue.  The diver sun--slow dived from
noon--goes down; my soul mounts up! she wearies with her endless
hill.  Is, then, the crown too heavy that I wear? this Iron Crown of
Lombardy.  Yet is it bright with many a gem; I the wearer, see not
its far flashings; but darkly feel that I wear that, that dazzlingly
confounds.  'Tis iron--that I know--not gold.  'Tis split, too--that
I feel; the jagged edge galls me so, my brain seems to beat against
the solid metal; aye, steel skull, mine; the sort that needs no
helmet in the most brain-battering fight!

Dry heat upon my brow?  Oh! time was, when as the sunrise nobly
spurred me, so the sunset soothed.  No more.  This lovely light, it
lights not me; all loveliness is anguish to me, since I can ne'er
enjoy.  Gifted with the high perception, I lack the low, enjoying
power; damned, most subtly and most malignantly! damned in the midst
of Paradise!  Good night--good night! (WAVING HIS HAND, HE MOVES FROM
THE WINDOW.)

'Twas not so hard a task.  I thought to find one stubborn, at the
least; but my one cogged circle fits into all their various wheels,
and they revolve.  Or, if you will, like so many ant-hills of powder,
they all stand before me; and I their match.  Oh, hard! that to fire
others, the match itself must needs be wasting!  What I've dared,
I've willed; and what I've willed, I'll do!  They think me
mad--Starbuck does; but I'm demoniac, I am madness maddened!  That
wild madness that's only calm to comprehend itself!  The prophecy was
that I should be dismembered; and--Aye!  I lost this leg.  I now
prophesy that I will dismember my dismemberer.  Now, then, be the
prophet and the fulfiller one.  That's more than ye, ye great gods,
ever were.  I laugh and hoot at ye, ye cricket-players, ye pugilists,
ye deaf Burkes and blinded Bendigoes!  I will not say as schoolboys
do to bullies--Take some one of your own size; don't pommel ME!  No,
ye've knocked me down, and I am up again; but YE have run and hidden.
Come forth from behind your cotton bags!  I have no long gun to
reach ye.  Come, Ahab's compliments to ye; come and see if ye can
swerve me.  Swerve me? ye cannot swerve me, else ye swerve
yourselves! man has ye there.  Swerve me?  The path to my fixed
purpose is laid with iron rails, whereon my soul is grooved to run.
Over unsounded gorges, through the rifled hearts of mountains, under
torrents' beds, unerringly I rush!  Naught's an obstacle, naught's an
angle to the iron way!



CHAPTER 38

Dusk.


BY THE MAINMAST; STARBUCK LEANING AGAINST IT.


My soul is more than matched; she's overmanned; and by a madman!
Insufferable sting, that sanity should ground arms on such a field!
But he drilled deep down, and blasted all my reason out of me!  I
think I see his impious end; but feel that I must help him to it.
Will I, nill I, the ineffable thing has tied me to him; tows me with
a cable I have no knife to cut.  Horrible old man!  Who's over him,
he cries;--aye, he would be a democrat to all above; look, how he
lords it over all below!  Oh!  I plainly see my miserable office,--to
obey, rebelling; and worse yet, to hate with touch of pity!  For in
his eyes I read some lurid woe would shrivel me up, had I it.  Yet is
there hope.  Time and tide flow wide.  The hated whale has the round
watery world to swim in, as the small gold-fish has its glassy globe.
His heaven-insulting purpose, God may wedge aside.  I would up
heart, were it not like lead.  But my whole clock's run down; my
heart the all-controlling weight, I have no key to lift again.


[A BURST OF REVELRY FROM THE FORECASTLE.]


Oh, God! to sail with such a heathen crew that have small touch of
human mothers in them!  Whelped somewhere by the sharkish sea.  The
white whale is their demigorgon.  Hark! the infernal orgies! that
revelry is forward! mark the unfaltering silence aft!  Methinks it
pictures life.  Foremost through the sparkling sea shoots on the gay,
embattled, bantering bow, but only to drag dark Ahab after it, where
he broods within his sternward cabin, builded over the dead water of
the wake, and further on, hunted by its wolfish gurglings.  The long
howl thrills me through!  Peace! ye revellers, and set the watch!
Oh, life!  'tis in an hour like this, with soul beat down and held to
knowledge,--as wild, untutored things are forced to feed--Oh, life!
'tis now that I do feel the latent horror in thee! but 'tis not me!
that horror's out of me! and with the soft feeling of the human in
me, yet will I try to fight ye, ye grim, phantom futures!  Stand by
me, hold me, bind me, O ye blessed influences!



CHAPTER 39

First Night Watch.

Fore-Top.

(STUBB SOLUS, AND MENDING A BRACE.)


Ha! ha! ha! ha! hem! clear my throat!--I've been thinking over it
ever since, and that ha, ha's the final consequence.  Why so?
Because a laugh's the wisest, easiest answer to all that's queer; and
come what will, one comfort's always left--that unfailing comfort is,
it's all predestinated.  I heard not all his talk with Starbuck; but
to my poor eye Starbuck then looked something as I the other evening
felt.  Be sure the old Mogul has fixed him, too.  I twigged it, knew
it; had had the gift, might readily have prophesied it--for when I
clapped my eye upon his skull I saw it.  Well, Stubb, WISE
Stubb--that's my title--well, Stubb, what of it, Stubb?  Here's a
carcase.  I know not all that may be coming, but be it what it will,
I'll go to it laughing.  Such a waggish leering as lurks in all your
horribles!  I feel funny.  Fa, la! lirra, skirra!  What's my juicy
little pear at home doing now?  Crying its eyes out?--Giving a party
to the last arrived harpooneers, I dare say, gay as a frigate's
pennant, and so am I--fa, la! lirra, skirra!  Oh--

We'll drink to-night with hearts as light,
To love, as gay and fleeting
As bubbles that swim, on the beaker's brim,
And break on the lips while meeting.


A brave stave that--who calls?  Mr. Starbuck?  Aye, aye, sir--(ASIDE)
he's my superior, he has his too, if I'm not mistaken.--Aye, aye,
sir, just through with this job--coming.



CHAPTER 40

Midnight, Forecastle.

HARPOONEERS AND SAILORS.

(FORESAIL RISES AND DISCOVERS THE WATCH STANDING, LOUNGING, LEANING,
AND LYING IN VARIOUS ATTITUDES, ALL SINGING IN CHORUS.)

Farewell and adieu to you, Spanish ladies!
Farewell and adieu to you, ladies of Spain!
Our captain's commanded.--

1ST NANTUCKET SAILOR.
Oh, boys, don't be sentimental; it's bad for the digestion!  Take a
tonic, follow me!
(SINGS, AND ALL FOLLOW)

Our captain stood upon the deck,
A spy-glass in his hand,
A viewing of those gallant whales
That blew at every strand.
Oh, your tubs in your boats, my boys,
And by your braces stand,
And we'll have one of those fine whales,
Hand, boys, over hand!
So, be cheery, my lads! may your hearts never fail!
While the bold harpooner is striking the whale!

MATE'S VOICE FROM THE QUARTER-DECK.
Eight bells there, forward!

2ND NANTUCKET SAILOR.
Avast the chorus!  Eight bells there! d'ye hear, bell-boy?  Strike
the bell eight, thou Pip! thou blackling! and let me call the watch.
I've the sort of mouth for that--the hogshead mouth.  So, so,
(THRUSTS HIS HEAD DOWN THE SCUTTLE,) Star-bo-l-e-e-n-s, a-h-o-y!
Eight bells there below!  Tumble up!

DUTCH SAILOR.
Grand snoozing to-night, maty; fat night for that.  I mark this in
our old Mogul's wine; it's quite as deadening to some as filliping to
others.  We sing; they sleep--aye, lie down there, like ground-tier
butts.  At 'em again!  There, take this copper-pump, and hail 'em
through it.  Tell 'em to avast dreaming of their lasses.  Tell 'em
it's the resurrection; they must kiss their last, and come to
judgment.  That's the way--THAT'S it; thy throat ain't spoiled with
eating Amsterdam butter.

FRENCH SAILOR.
Hist, boys! let's have a jig or two before we ride to anchor in
Blanket Bay.  What say ye?  There comes the other watch.  Stand by
all legs!  Pip! little Pip! hurrah with your tambourine!

PIP.
(SULKY AND SLEEPY)
Don't know where it is.

FRENCH SAILOR.
Beat thy belly, then, and wag thy ears.  Jig it, men, I say; merry's
the word; hurrah!  Damn me, won't you dance?  Form, now, Indian-file,
and gallop into the double-shuffle?  Throw yourselves!  Legs! legs!

ICELAND SAILOR.
I don't like your floor, maty; it's too springy to my taste.  I'm
used to ice-floors.  I'm sorry to throw cold water on the subject;
but excuse me.

MALTESE SAILOR.
Me too; where's your girls?  Who but a fool would take his left hand
by his right, and say to himself, how d'ye do?  Partners!  I must
have partners!

SICILIAN SAILOR.
Aye; girls and a green!--then I'll hop with ye; yea, turn
grasshopper!

LONG-ISLAND SAILOR.
Well, well, ye sulkies, there's plenty more of us.  Hoe corn when you
may, say I.  All legs go to harvest soon.  Ah! here comes the music;
now for it!

AZORE SAILOR.
(ASCENDING, AND PITCHING THE TAMBOURINE UP THE SCUTTLE.)
Here you are, Pip; and there's the windlass-bitts; up you mount!
Now, boys!
(THE HALF OF THEM DANCE TO THE TAMBOURINE; SOME GO BELOW; SOME SLEEP
OR LIE AMONG THE COILS OF RIGGING.  OATHS A-PLENTY.)

AZORE SAILOR.
(DANCING)
Go it, Pip!  Bang it, bell-boy!  Rig it, dig it, stig it, quig it,
bell-boy!  Make fire-flies; break the jinglers!

PIP.
Jinglers, you say?--there goes another, dropped off; I pound it so.

CHINA SAILOR.
Rattle thy teeth, then, and pound away; make a pagoda of thyself.


FRENCH SAILOR.
Merry-mad!  Hold up thy hoop, Pip, till I jump through it!  Split
jibs! tear yourselves!

TASHTEGO.
(QUIETLY SMOKING)
That's a white man; he calls that fun: humph!  I save my sweat.

OLD MANX SAILOR.
I wonder whether those jolly lads bethink them of what they are
dancing over.  I'll dance over your grave, I will--that's the
bitterest threat of your night-women, that beat head-winds round
corners.  O Christ! to think of the green navies and the
green-skulled crews!  Well, well; belike the whole world's a ball, as
you scholars have it; and so 'tis right to make one ballroom of it.
Dance on, lads, you're young; I was once.

3D NANTUCKET SAILOR.
Spell oh!--whew! this is worse than pulling after whales in a
calm--give us a whiff, Tash.

(THEY CEASE DANCING, AND GATHER IN CLUSTERS.  MEANTIME THE SKY

By Brahma! boys, it'll be douse sail soon.  The sky-born, high-tide
Ganges turned to wind!  Thou showest thy black brow, Seeva!

MALTESE SAILOR.
(RECLINING AND SHAKING HIS CAP.)
It's the waves--the snow's caps turn to jig it now.  They'll shake
their tassels soon.  Now would all the waves were women, then I'd go
drown, and chassee with them evermore!  There's naught so sweet on
earth--heaven may not match it!--as those swift glances of warm, wild
bosoms in the dance, when the over-arboring arms hide such ripe,
bursting grapes.

SICILIAN SAILOR.
(RECLINING.)
Tell me not of it!  Hark ye, lad--fleet interlacings of the

satiety.  Eh, Pagan? (NUDGING.)

TAHITAN SAILOR.
(RECLINING ON A MAT.)
Hail, holy nakedness of our dancing girls!--the Heeva-Heeva!  Ah! low
veiled, high palmed Tahiti!  I still rest me on thy mat, but the soft
soil has slid!  I saw thee woven in the wood, my mat! green the first
day I brought ye thence; now worn and wilted quite.  Ah me!--not thou
nor I can bear the change!  How then, if so be transplanted to yon
sky?  Hear I the roaring streams from Pirohitee's peak of spears,
when they leap down the crags and drown the villages?--The blast! the
blast!  Up, spine, and meet it! (LEAPS TO HIS FEET.)

PORTUGUESE SAILOR.
How the sea rolls swashing 'gainst the side!  Stand by for reefing,
hearties! the winds are just crossing swords, pell-mell they'll go
lunging presently.

DANISH SAILOR.
Crack, crack, old ship! so long as thou crackest, thou holdest!  Well
done!  The mate there holds ye to it stiffly.  He's no more afraid
than the isle fort at Cattegat, put there to fight the Baltic with
storm-lashed guns, on which the sea-salt cakes!

4TH NANTUCKET SAILOR.
He has his orders, mind ye that.  I heard old Ahab tell him he must
always kill a squall, something as they burst a waterspout with a
pistol--fire your ship right into it!

Blood! but that old man's a grand old cove!  We are the lads to hunt
him up his whale!

ALL.
Aye! aye!

OLD MANX SAILOR.
How the three pines shake!  Pines are the hardest sort of tree to
live when shifted to any other soil, and here there's none but the
crew's cursed clay.  Steady, helmsman! steady.  This is the sort of
weather when brave hearts snap ashore, and keeled hulls split at sea.
Our captain has his birthmark; look yonder, boys, there's another in
the sky--lurid-like, ye see, all else pitch black.

go, all cursing, and here I don't.  Fine prospects to 'em; they're on
the road to heaven.  Hold on hard!  Jimmini, what a squall!  But
those chaps there are worse yet--they are your white squalls, they.
White squalls? white whale, shirr! shirr!  Here have I heard all
their chat just now, and the white whale--shirr! shirr!--but spoken
of once! and only this evening--it makes me jingle all over like my
tambourine--that anaconda of an old man swore 'em in to hunt him!
Oh, thou big white God aloft there somewhere in yon darkness, have
mercy on this small black boy down here; preserve him from all men
that have no bowels to feel fear!



CHAPTER 41

Moby Dick.


I, Ishmael, was one of that crew; my shouts had gone up with the
rest; my oath had been welded with theirs; and stronger I shouted,
and more did I hammer and clinch my oath, because of the dread in my
soul.  A wild, mystical, sympathetical feeling was in me; Ahab's
quenchless feud seemed mine.  With greedy ears I learned the history
of that murderous monster against whom I and all the others had taken
our oaths of violence and revenge.

For some time past, though at intervals only, the unaccompanied,
secluded White Whale had haunted those uncivilized seas mostly
frequented by the Sperm Whale fishermen.  But not all of them knew of
his existence; only a few of them, comparatively, had knowingly seen
him; while the number who as yet had actually and knowingly given
battle to him, was small indeed.  For, owing to the large number of
whale-cruisers; the disorderly way they were sprinkled over the
entire watery circumference, many of them adventurously pushing their
quest along solitary latitudes, so as seldom or never for a whole
twelvemonth or more on a stretch, to encounter a single news-telling
sail of any sort; the inordinate length of each separate voyage; the
irregularity of the times of sailing from home; all these, with other
circumstances, direct and indirect, long obstructed the spread
through the whole world-wide whaling-fleet of the special
individualizing tidings concerning Moby Dick.  It was hardly to be
doubted, that several vessels reported to have encountered, at such
or such a time, or on such or such a meridian, a Sperm Whale of
uncommon magnitude and malignity, which whale, after doing great
mischief to his assailants, had completely escaped them; to some
minds it was not an unfair presumption, I say, that the whale in
question must have been no other than Moby Dick.  Yet as of late the
Sperm Whale fishery had been marked by various and not unfrequent
instances of great ferocity, cunning, and malice in the monster
attacked; therefore it was, that those who by accident ignorantly
gave battle to Moby Dick; such hunters, perhaps, for the most part,
were content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred, more, as it
were, to the perils of the Sperm Whale fishery at large, than to the
individual cause.  In that way, mostly, the disastrous encounter
between Ahab and the whale had hitherto been popularly regarded.

And as for those who, previously hearing of the White Whale, by
chance caught sight of him; in the beginning of the thing they had
every one of them, almost, as boldly and fearlessly lowered for him,
as for any other whale of that species.  But at length, such
calamities did ensue in these assaults--not restricted to sprained
wrists and ankles, broken limbs, or devouring amputations--but fatal
to the last degree of fatality; those repeated disastrous repulses,
all accumulating and piling their terrors upon Moby Dick; those
things had gone far to shake the fortitude of many brave hunters, to
whom the story of the White Whale had eventually come.

Nor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate, and still the
more horrify the true histories of these deadly encounters.  For not
only do fabulous rumors naturally grow out of the very body of all
surprising terrible events,--as the smitten tree gives birth to its
fungi; but, in maritime life, far more than in that of terra firma,
wild rumors abound, wherever there is any adequate reality for them
to cling to.  And as the sea surpasses the land in this matter, so
the whale fishery surpasses every other sort of maritime life, in the
wonderfulness and fearfulness of the rumors which sometimes circulate
there.  For not only are whalemen as a body unexempt from that
ignorance and superstitiousness hereditary to all sailors; but of all
sailors, they are by all odds the most directly brought into contact
with whatever is appallingly astonishing in the sea; face to face
they not only eye its greatest marvels, but, hand to jaw, give battle
to them.  Alone, in such remotest waters, that though you sailed a
thousand miles, and passed a thousand shores, you would not come to
any chiseled hearth-stone, or aught hospitable beneath that part of
the sun; in such latitudes and longitudes, pursuing too such a
calling as he does, the whaleman is wrapped by influences all tending
to make his fancy pregnant with many a mighty birth.

No wonder, then, that ever gathering volume from the mere transit
over the widest watery spaces, the outblown rumors of the White Whale
did in the end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid
hints, and half-formed foetal suggestions of supernatural agencies,
which eventually invested Moby Dick with new terrors unborrowed from
anything that visibly appears.  So that in many cases such a panic
did he finally strike, that few who by those rumors, at least, had
heard of the White Whale, few of those hunters were willing to
encounter the perils of his jaw.

But there were still other and more vital practical influences at
work.  Not even at the present day has the original prestige of the
Sperm Whale, as fearfully distinguished from all other species of the
leviathan, died out of the minds of the whalemen as a body.  There
are those this day among them, who, though intelligent and courageous
enough in offering battle to the Greenland or Right whale, would
perhaps--either from professional inexperience, or incompetency, or
timidity, decline a contest with the Sperm Whale; at any rate, there
are plenty of whalemen, especially among those whaling nations not
sailing under the American flag, who have never hostilely encountered
the Sperm Whale, but whose sole knowledge of the leviathan is
restricted to the ignoble monster primitively pursued in the North;
seated on their hatches, these men will hearken with a childish
fireside interest and awe, to the wild, strange tales of Southern
whaling.  Nor is the pre-eminent tremendousness of the great Sperm
Whale anywhere more feelingly comprehended, than on board of those
prows which stem him.

And as if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendary
times thrown its shadow before it; we find some book
naturalists--Olassen and Povelson--declaring the Sperm Whale not only
to be a consternation to every other creature in the sea, but also to
be so incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human
blood.  Nor even down to so late a time as Cuvier's, were these or
almost similar impressions effaced.  For in his Natural History, the
Baron himself affirms that at sight of the Sperm Whale, all fish
(sharks included) are struck with the most lively terrors, and
often in the precipitancy of their flight dash themselves against"
3357	"the rocks with such violence as to cause instantaneous death.  And
however the general experiences in the fishery may amend such reports
as these; yet in their full terribleness, even to the bloodthirsty
item of Povelson, the superstitious belief in them is, in some
vicissitudes of their vocation, revived in the minds of the hunters.

So that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning him, not a few
of the fishermen recalled, in reference to Moby Dick, the earlier
days of the Sperm Whale fishery, when it was oftentimes hard to
induce long practised Right whalemen to embark in the perils of this
new and daring warfare; such men protesting that although other
leviathans might be hopefully pursued, yet to chase and point lance
at such an apparition as the Sperm Whale was not for mortal man.
That to attempt it, would be inevitably to be torn into a quick
eternity.  On this head, there are some remarkable documents that may
be consulted.

Nevertheless, some there were, who even in the face of these things
were ready to give chase to Moby Dick; and a still greater number
who, chancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely, without the
specific details of any certain calamity, and without superstitious
accompaniments, were sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle
if offered.

One of the wild suggestions referred to, as at last coming to be
linked with the White Whale in the minds of the superstitiously
inclined, was the unearthly conceit that Moby Dick was ubiquitous;
that he had actually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one
and the same instant of time.

Nor, credulous as such minds must have been, was this conceit
altogether without some faint show of superstitious probability.  For
as the secrets of the currents in the seas have never yet been
divulged, even to the most erudite research; so the hidden ways of
the Sperm Whale when beneath the surface remain, in great part,
unaccountable to his pursuers; and from time to time have originated
the most curious and contradictory speculations regarding them,
especially concerning the mystic modes whereby, after sounding to a
great depth, he transports himself with such vast swiftness to the
most widely distant points.

It is a thing well known to both American and English whale-ships,
and as well a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by
Scoresby, that some whales have been captured far north in the
Pacific, in whose bodies have been found the barbs of harpoons darted
in the Greenland seas.  Nor is it to be gainsaid, that in some of
these instances it has been declared that the interval of time
between the two assaults could not have exceeded very many days.
Hence, by inference, it has been believed by some whalemen, that the
Nor' West Passage, so long a problem to man, was never a problem to
the whale.  So that here, in the real living experience of living
men, the prodigies related in old times of the inland Strello
mountain in Portugal (near whose top there was said to be a lake in
which the wrecks of ships floated up to the surface); and that still
more wonderful story of the Arethusa fountain near Syracuse (whose
waters were believed to have come from the Holy Land by an
underground passage); these fabulous narrations are almost fully
equalled by the realities of the whalemen.

Forced into familiarity, then, with such prodigies as these; and
knowing that after repeated, intrepid assaults, the White Whale had
escaped alive; it cannot be much matter of surprise that some
whalemen should go still further in their superstitions; declaring
Moby Dick not only ubiquitous, but immortal (for immortality is but
ubiquity in time); that though groves of spears should be planted in
his flanks, he would still swim away unharmed; or if indeed he should
ever be made to spout thick blood, such a sight would be but a
ghastly deception; for again in unensanguined billows hundreds of
leagues away, his unsullied jet would once more be seen.

But even stripped of these supernatural surmisings, there was enough
in the earthly make and incontestable character of the monster to
strike the imagination with unwonted power.  For, it was not so much
his uncommon bulk that so much distinguished him from other sperm
whales, but, as was elsewhere thrown out--a peculiar snow-white
wrinkled forehead, and a high, pyramidical white hump.  These were
his prominent features; the tokens whereby, even in the limitless,
uncharted seas, he revealed his identity, at a long distance, to
those who knew him.

The rest of his body was so streaked, and spotted, and marbled with
the same shrouded hue, that, in the end, he had gained his
distinctive appellation of the White Whale; a name, indeed, literally
justified by his vivid aspect, when seen gliding at high noon through
a dark blue sea, leaving a milky-way wake of creamy foam, all
spangled with golden gleamings.

Nor was it his unwonted magnitude, nor his remarkable hue, nor yet
his deformed lower jaw, that so much invested the whale with natural
terror, as that unexampled, intelligent malignity which, according to
specific accounts, he had over and over again evinced in his
assaults.  More than all, his treacherous retreats struck more of
dismay than perhaps aught else.  For, when swimming before his
exulting pursuers, with every apparent symptom of alarm, he had
several times been known to turn round suddenly, and, bearing down
upon them, either stave their boats to splinters, or drive them back
in consternation to their ship.

Already several fatalities had attended his chase.  But though
similar disasters, however little bruited ashore, were by no means
unusual in the fishery; yet, in most instances, such seemed the White
Whale's infernal aforethought of ferocity, that every dismembering or
death that he caused, was not wholly regarded as having been
inflicted by an unintelligent agent.

Judge, then, to what pitches of inflamed, distracted fury the minds
of his more desperate hunters were impelled, when amid the chips of
chewed boats, and the sinking limbs of torn comrades, they swam out
of the white curds of the whale's direful wrath into the serene,
exasperating sunlight, that smiled on, as if at a birth or a bridal.

His three boats stove around him, and oars and men both whirling in
the eddies; one captain, seizing the line-knife from his broken prow,
had dashed at the whale, as an Arkansas duellist at his foe, blindly
seeking with a six inch blade to reach the fathom-deep life of the
whale.  That captain was Ahab.  And then it was, that suddenly
sweeping his sickle-shaped lower jaw beneath him, Moby Dick had
reaped away Ahab's leg, as a mower a blade of grass in the field.  No
turbaned Turk, no hired Venetian or Malay, could have smote him with
more seeming malice.  Small reason was there to doubt, then, that
ever since that almost fatal encounter, Ahab had cherished a wild
vindictiveness against the whale, all the more fell for that in his
frantic morbidness he at last came to identify with him, not only all
his bodily woes, but all his intellectual and spiritual
exasperations.  The White Whale swam before him as the monomaniac
incarnation of all those malicious agencies which some deep men feel
eating in them, till they are left living on with half a heart and
half a lung.  That intangible malignity which has been from the
beginning; to whose dominion even the modern Christians ascribe
one-half of the worlds; which the ancient Ophites of the east
reverenced in their statue devil;--Ahab did not fall down and worship
it like them; but deliriously transferring its idea to the abhorred
white whale, he pitted himself, all mutilated, against it.  All that
most maddens and torments; all that stirs up the lees of things; all
truth with malice in it; all that cracks the sinews and cakes the
brain; all the subtle demonisms of life and thought; all evil, to
crazy Ahab, were visibly personified, and made practically assailable
in Moby Dick.  He piled upon the whale's white hump the sum of all
the general rage and hate felt by his whole race from Adam down; and
then, as if his chest had been a mortar, he burst his hot heart's
shell upon it.

It is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise
at the precise time of his bodily dismemberment.  Then, in darting at
the monster, knife in hand, he had but given loose to a sudden,
passionate, corporal animosity; and when he received the stroke that
tore him, he probably but felt the agonizing bodily laceration, but
nothing more.  Yet, when by this collision forced to turn towards
home, and for long months of days and weeks, Ahab and anguish lay
stretched together in one hammock, rounding in mid winter that
dreary, howling Patagonian Cape; then it was, that his torn body and
gashed soul bled into one another; and so interfusing, made him mad.
That it was only then, on the homeward voyage, after the encounter,
that the final monomania seized him, seems all but certain from the
fact that, at intervals during the passage, he was a raving lunatic;
and, though unlimbed of a leg, yet such vital strength yet lurked in
his Egyptian chest, and was moreover intensified by his delirium,
that his mates were forced to lace him fast, even there, as he
sailed, raving in his hammock.  In a strait-jacket, he swung to the
mad rockings of the gales.  And, when running into more sufferable
latitudes, the ship, with mild stun'sails spread, floated across the
tranquil tropics, and, to all appearances, the old man's delirium
seemed left behind him with the Cape Horn swells, and he came forth
from his dark den into the blessed light and air; even then, when he
bore that firm, collected front, however pale, and issued his calm
orders once again; and his mates thanked God the direful madness was
now gone; even then, Ahab, in his hidden self, raved on.  Human
madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing.  When you
think it fled, it may have but become transfigured into some still
subtler form.  Ahab's full lunacy subsided not, but deepeningly
contracted; like the unabated Hudson, when that noble Northman flows
narrowly, but unfathomably through the Highland gorge.  But, as in
his narrow-flowing monomania, not one jot of Ahab's broad madness had
been left behind; so in that broad madness, not one jot of his great
natural intellect had perished.  That before living agent, now became
the living instrument.  If such a furious trope may stand, his
special lunacy stormed his general sanity, and carried it, and turned
all its concentred cannon upon its own mad mark; so that far from
having lost his strength, Ahab, to that one end, did now possess a
thousand fold more potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear
upon any one reasonable object.

This is much; yet Ahab's larger, darker, deeper part remains
unhinted.  But vain to popularize profundities, and all truth is
profound.  Winding far down from within the very heart of this spiked
Hotel de Cluny where we here stand--however grand and wonderful, now
quit it;--and take your way, ye nobler, sadder souls, to those vast
Roman halls of Thermes; where far beneath the fantastic towers of
man's upper earth, his root of grandeur, his whole awful essence sits
in bearded state; an antique buried beneath antiquities, and throned
on torsoes!  So with a broken throne, the great gods mock that
captive king; so like a Caryatid, he patient sits, upholding on his
frozen brow the piled entablatures of ages.  Wind ye down there, ye
prouder, sadder souls! question that proud, sad king!  A family
likeness! aye, he did beget ye, ye young exiled royalties; and from
your grim sire only will the old State-secret come.

Now, in his heart, Ahab had some glimpse of this, namely: all my
means are sane, my motive and my object mad.  Yet without power to
kill, or change, or shun the fact; he likewise knew that to mankind
he did long dissemble; in some sort, did still.  But that thing of
his dissembling was only subject to his perceptibility, not to his
will determinate.  Nevertheless, so well did he succeed in that
dissembling, that when with ivory leg he stepped ashore at last, no
Nantucketer thought him otherwise than but naturally grieved, and
that to the quick, with the terrible casualty which had overtaken
him.

The report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise popularly
ascribed to a kindred cause.  And so too, all the added moodiness
which always afterwards, to the very day of sailing in the Pequod on
the present voyage, sat brooding on his brow.  Nor is it so very
unlikely, that far from distrusting his fitness for another whaling
voyage, on account of such dark symptoms, the calculating people of
that prudent isle were inclined to harbor the conceit, that for those
very reasons he was all the better qualified and set on edge, for a
pursuit so full of rage and wildness as the bloody hunt of whales.
Gnawed within and scorched without, with the infixed, unrelenting
fangs of some incurable idea; such an one, could he be found, would
seem the very man to dart his iron and lift his lance against the
most appalling of all brutes.  Or, if for any reason thought to be
corporeally incapacitated for that, yet such an one would seem
superlatively competent to cheer and howl on his underlings to the
attack.  But be all this as it may, certain it is, that with the mad
secret of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in him, Ahab had
purposely sailed upon the present voyage with the one only and
all-engrossing object of hunting the White Whale.  Had any one of his
old acquaintances on shore but half dreamed of what was lurking in
him then, how soon would their aghast and righteous souls have
wrenched the ship from such a fiendish man!  They were bent on
profitable cruises, the profit to be counted down in dollars from the
mint.  He was intent on an audacious, immitigable, and supernatural
revenge.

Here, then, was this grey-headed, ungodly old man, chasing with
curses a Job's whale round the world, at the head of a crew, too,
chiefly made up of mongrel renegades, and castaways, and
cannibals--morally enfeebled also, by the incompetence of mere
unaided virtue or right-mindedness in Starbuck, the invunerable
jollity of indifference and recklessness in Stubb, and the pervading
mediocrity in Flask.  Such a crew, so officered, seemed specially
picked and packed by some infernal fatality to help him to his
monomaniac revenge.  How it was that they so aboundingly responded to
the old man's ire--by what evil magic their souls were possessed,
that at times his hate seemed almost theirs; the White Whale as much
their insufferable foe as his; how all this came to be--what the
White Whale was to them, or how to their unconscious understandings,
also, in some dim, unsuspected way, he might have seemed the gliding
great demon of the seas of life,--all this to explain, would be to
dive deeper than Ishmael can go.  The subterranean miner that works
in us all, how can one tell whither leads his shaft by the ever
shifting, muffled sound of his pick?  Who does not feel the
irresistible arm drag?  What skiff in tow of a seventy-four can stand
still?  For one, I gave myself up to the abandonment of the time and
the place; but while yet all a-rush to encounter the whale, could see
naught in that brute but the deadliest ill.



CHAPTER 42

The Whiteness of The Whale.


What the white whale was to Ahab, has been hinted; what, at times, he
was to me, as yet remains unsaid.

Aside from those more obvious considerations touching Moby Dick,
which could not but occasionally awaken in any man's soul some alarm,
there was another thought, or rather vague, nameless horror
concerning him, which at times by its intensity completely
overpowered all the rest; and yet so mystical and well nigh ineffable
was it, that I almost despair of putting it in a comprehensible form.
It was the whiteness of the whale that above all things appalled me.
But how can I hope to explain myself here; and yet, in some dim,
random way, explain myself I must, else all these chapters might be
naught.

Though in many natural objects, whiteness refiningly enhances beauty,
as if imparting some special virtue of its own, as in marbles,
japonicas, and pearls; and though various nations have in some way
recognised a certain royal preeminence in this hue; even the
barbaric, grand old kings of Pegu placing the title Lord of the"
3358	"White Elephants above all their other magniloquent ascriptions of
dominion; and the modern kings of Siam unfurling the same snow-white
quadruped in the royal standard; and the Hanoverian flag bearing the
one figure of a snow-white charger; and the great Austrian Empire,
Caesarian, heir to overlording Rome, having for the imperial colour
the same imperial hue; and though this pre-eminence in it applies to
the human race itself, giving the white man ideal mastership over
every dusky tribe; and though, besides, all this, whiteness has been
even made significant of gladness, for among the Romans a white stone
marked a joyful day; and though in other mortal sympathies and
symbolizings, this same hue is made the emblem of many touching,
noble things--the innocence of brides, the benignity of age; though
among the Red Men of America the giving of the white belt of wampum
was the deepest pledge of honour; though in many climes, whiteness
typifies the majesty of Justice in the ermine of the Judge, and
contributes to the daily state of kings and queens drawn by
milk-white steeds; though even in the higher mysteries of the most
august religions it has been made the symbol of the divine
spotlessness and power; by the Persian fire worshippers, the white
forked flame being held the holiest on the altar; and in the Greek
mythologies, Great Jove himself being made incarnate in a snow-white
bull; and though to the noble Iroquois, the midwinter sacrifice of
the sacred White Dog was by far the holiest festival of their
theology, that spotless, faithful creature being held the purest
envoy they could send to the Great Spirit with the annual tidings of
their own fidelity; and though directly from the Latin word for
white, all Christian priests derive the name of one part of their
sacred vesture, the alb or tunic, worn beneath the cassock; and
though among the holy pomps of the Romish faith, white is specially
employed in the celebration of the Passion of our Lord; though in the
Vision of St. John, white robes are given to the redeemed, and the
four-and-twenty elders stand clothed in white before the great-white
throne, and the Holy One that sitteth there white like wool; yet for
all these accumulated associations, with whatever is sweet, and
honourable, and sublime, there yet lurks an elusive something in the
innermost idea of this hue, which strikes more of panic to the soul
than that redness which affrights in blood.

This elusive quality it is, which causes the thought of whiteness,
when divorced from more kindly associations, and coupled with any
object terrible in itself, to heighten that terror to the furthest
bounds.  Witness the white bear of the poles, and the white shark of
the tropics; what but their smooth, flaky whiteness makes them the
transcendent horrors they are?  That ghastly whiteness it is which
imparts such an abhorrent mildness, even more loathsome than
terrific, to the dumb gloating of their aspect.  So that not the
fierce-fanged tiger in his heraldic coat can so stagger courage as
the white-shrouded bear or shark.*


*With reference to the Polar bear, it may possibly be urged by him
who would fain go still deeper into this matter, that it is not the
whiteness, separately regarded, which heightens the intolerable
hideousness of that brute; for, analysed, that heightened
hideousness, it might be said, only rises from the circumstance, that
the irresponsible ferociousness of the creature stands invested in
the fleece of celestial innocence and love; and hence, by bringing
together two such opposite emotions in our minds, the Polar bear
frightens us with so unnatural a contrast.  But even assuming all
this to be true; yet, were it not for the whiteness, you would not
have that intensified terror.

As for the white shark, the white gliding ghostliness of repose in
that creature, when beheld in his ordinary moods, strangely tallies
with the same quality in the Polar quadruped.  This peculiarity is
most vividly hit by the French in the name they bestow upon that
fish.  The Romish mass for the dead begins with Requiem eternam
(eternal rest), whence REQUIEM denominating the mass itself, and any
other funeral music.  Now, in allusion to the white, silent stillness
of death in this shark, and the mild deadliness of his habits, the
French call him REQUIN.


Bethink thee of the albatross, whence come those clouds of spiritual
wonderment and pale dread, in which that white phantom sails in all
imaginations?  Not Coleridge first threw that spell; but God's great,
unflattering laureate, Nature.*


*I remember the first albatross I ever saw.  It was during a
prolonged gale, in waters hard upon the Antarctic seas.  From my
forenoon watch below, I ascended to the overclouded deck; and there,
dashed upon the main hatches, I saw a regal, feathery thing of
unspotted whiteness, and with a hooked, Roman bill sublime.  At
intervals, it arched forth its vast archangel wings, as if to embrace
some holy ark.  Wondrous flutterings and throbbings shook it.  Though
bodily unharmed, it uttered cries, as some king's ghost in
supernatural distress.  Through its inexpressible, strange eyes,
methought I peeped to secrets which took hold of God.  As Abraham
before the angels, I bowed myself; the white thing was so white, its
wings so wide, and in those for ever exiled waters, I had lost the
miserable warping memories of traditions and of towns.  Long I gazed
at that prodigy of plumage.  I cannot tell, can only hint, the things
that darted through me then.  But at last I awoke; and turning, asked
a sailor what bird was this.  A goney, he replied.  Goney! never had
heard that name before; is it conceivable that this glorious thing is
utterly unknown to men ashore! never!  But some time after, I learned
that goney was some seaman's name for albatross.  So that by no
possibility could Coleridge's wild Rhyme have had aught to do with
those mystical impressions which were mine, when I saw that bird upon
our deck.  For neither had I then read the Rhyme, nor knew the bird
to be an albatross.  Yet, in saying this, I do but indirectly burnish
a little brighter the noble merit of the poem and the poet.

I assert, then, that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird
chiefly lurks the secret of the spell; a truth the more evinced in
this, that by a solecism of terms there are birds called grey
albatrosses; and these I have frequently seen, but never with such
emotions as when I beheld the Antarctic fowl.

But how had the mystic thing been caught?  Whisper it not, and I will
tell; with a treacherous hook and line, as the fowl floated on the
sea.  At last the Captain made a postman of it; tying a lettered,
leathern tally round its neck, with the ship's time and place; and
then letting it escape.  But I doubt not, that leathern tally, meant
for man, was taken off in Heaven, when the white fowl flew to join
the wing-folding, the invoking, and adoring cherubim!


Most famous in our Western annals and Indian traditions is that of
the White Steed of the Prairies; a magnificent milk-white charger,
large-eyed, small-headed, bluff-chested, and with the dignity of a
thousand monarchs in his lofty, overscorning carriage.  He was the
elected Xerxes of vast herds of wild horses, whose pastures in those
days were only fenced by the Rocky Mountains and the Alleghanies.  At
their flaming head he westward trooped it like that chosen star which
every evening leads on the hosts of light.  The flashing cascade of
his mane, the curving comet of his tail, invested him with housings
more resplendent than gold and silver-beaters could have furnished
him.  A most imperial and archangelical apparition of that unfallen,
western world, which to the eyes of the old trappers and hunters
revived the glories of those primeval times when Adam walked majestic
as a god, bluff-browed and fearless as this mighty steed.  Whether
marching amid his aides and marshals in the van of countless cohorts
that endlessly streamed it over the plains, like an Ohio; or whether
with his circumambient subjects browsing all around at the horizon,
the White Steed gallopingly reviewed them with warm nostrils
reddening through his cool milkiness; in whatever aspect he presented
himself, always to the bravest Indians he was the object of trembling
reverence and awe.  Nor can it be questioned from what stands on
legendary record of this noble horse, that it was his spiritual
whiteness chiefly, which so clothed him with divineness; and that
this divineness had that in it which, though commanding worship, at
the same time enforced a certain nameless terror.

But there are other instances where this whiteness loses all that
accessory and strange glory which invests it in the White Steed and
Albatross.

What is it that in the Albino man so peculiarly repels and often
shocks the eye, as that sometimes he is loathed by his own kith and
kin!  It is that whiteness which invests him, a thing expressed by
the name he bears.  The Albino is as well made as other men--has no
substantive deformity--and yet this mere aspect of all-pervading
whiteness makes him more strangely hideous than the ugliest abortion.
Why should this be so?

Nor, in quite other aspects, does Nature in her least palpable but
not the less malicious agencies, fail to enlist among her forces this
crowning attribute of the terrible.  From its snowy aspect, the
gauntleted ghost of the Southern Seas has been denominated the White
Squall.  Nor, in some historic instances, has the art of human malice
omitted so potent an auxiliary.  How wildly it heightens the effect
of that passage in Froissart, when, masked in the snowy symbol of
their faction, the desperate White Hoods of Ghent murder their
bailiff in the market-place!

Nor, in some things, does the common, hereditary experience of all
mankind fail to bear witness to the supernaturalism of this hue.  It
cannot well be doubted, that the one visible quality in the aspect of
the dead which most appals the gazer, is the marble pallor lingering
there; as if indeed that pallor were as much like the badge of
consternation in the other world, as of mortal trepidation here.  And
from that pallor of the dead, we borrow the expressive hue of the
shroud in which we wrap them.  Nor even in our superstitions do we
fail to throw the same snowy mantle round our phantoms; all ghosts
rising in a milk-white fog--Yea, while these terrors seize us, let us
add, that even the king of terrors, when personified by the
evangelist, rides on his pallid horse.

Therefore, in his other moods, symbolize whatever grand or gracious
thing he will by whiteness, no man can deny that in its profoundest
idealized significance it calls up a peculiar apparition to the soul.

But though without dissent this point be fixed, how is mortal man to
account for it?  To analyse it, would seem impossible.  Can we,
then, by the citation of some of those instances wherein this thing
of whiteness--though for the time either wholly or in great part
stripped of all direct associations calculated to impart to it aught
fearful, but nevertheless, is found to exert over us the same
sorcery, however modified;--can we thus hope to light upon some
chance clue to conduct us to the hidden cause we seek?

Let us try.  But in a matter like this, subtlety appeals to subtlety,
and without imagination no man can follow another into these halls.
And though, doubtless, some at least of the imaginative impressions
about to be presented may have been shared by most men, yet few
perhaps were entirely conscious of them at the time, and therefore
may not be able to recall them now.

Why to the man of untutored ideality, who happens to be but loosely
acquainted with the peculiar character of the day, does the bare
mention of Whitsuntide marshal in the fancy such long, dreary,
speechless processions of slow-pacing pilgrims, down-cast and hooded
with new-fallen snow?  Or, to the unread, unsophisticated Protestant
of the Middle American States, why does the passing mention of a
White Friar or a White Nun, evoke such an eyeless statue in the soul?

Or what is there apart from the traditions of dungeoned warriors and
kings (which will not wholly account for it) that makes the White
Tower of London tell so much more strongly on the imagination of an
untravelled American, than those other storied structures, its
neighbors--the Byward Tower, or even the Bloody?  And those sublimer
towers, the White Mountains of New Hampshire, whence, in peculiar
moods, comes that gigantic ghostliness over the soul at the bare
mention of that name, while the thought of Virginia's Blue Ridge is
full of a soft, dewy, distant dreaminess?  Or why, irrespective of
all latitudes and longitudes, does the name of the White Sea exert
such a spectralness over the fancy, while that of the Yellow Sea
lulls us with mortal thoughts of long lacquered mild afternoons on
the waves, followed by the gaudiest and yet sleepiest of sunsets?
Or, to choose a wholly unsubstantial instance, purely addressed to
the fancy, why, in reading the old fairy tales of Central Europe,
does the tall pale man of the Hartz forests, whose changeless
pallor unrustlingly glides through the green of the groves--why is
this phantom more terrible than all the whooping imps of the
Blocksburg?

Nor is it, altogether, the remembrance of her cathedral-toppling
earthquakes; nor the stampedoes of her frantic seas; nor the
tearlessness of arid skies that never rain; nor the sight of her
wide field of leaning spires, wrenched cope-stones, and crosses all
adroop (like canted yards of anchored fleets); and her suburban
avenues of house-walls lying over upon each other, as a tossed pack
of cards;--it is not these things alone which make tearless Lima, the
strangest, saddest city thou can'st see.  For Lima has taken the
white veil; and there is a higher horror in this whiteness of her
woe.  Old as Pizarro, this whiteness keeps her ruins for ever new;
admits not the cheerful greenness of complete decay; spreads over her
broken ramparts the rigid pallor of an apoplexy that fixes its own
distortions.

I know that, to the common apprehension, this phenomenon of whiteness
is not confessed to be the prime agent in exaggerating the terror of
objects otherwise terrible; nor to the unimaginative mind is there
aught of terror in those appearances whose awfulness to another mind
almost solely consists in this one phenomenon, especially when
exhibited under any form at all approaching to muteness or
universality.  What I mean by these two statements may perhaps be
respectively elucidated by the following examples.

First: The mariner, when drawing nigh the coasts of foreign lands, if
by night he hear the roar of breakers, starts to vigilance, and feels
just enough of trepidation to sharpen all his faculties; but under
precisely similar circumstances, let him be called from his hammock
to view his ship sailing through a midnight sea of milky
whiteness--as if from encircling headlands shoals of combed white
bears were swimming round him, then he feels a silent, superstitious
dread; the shrouded phantom of the whitened waters is horrible to him
as a real ghost; in vain the lead assures him he is still off
soundings; heart and helm they both go down; he never rests till blue
water is under him again.  Yet where is the mariner who will tell
thee, Sir, it was not so much the fear of striking hidden rocks, as"
3359	"the fear of that hideous whiteness that so stirred me?

Second: To the native Indian of Peru, the continual sight of the
snowhowdahed Andes conveys naught of dread, except, perhaps, in the
mere fancying of the eternal frosted desolateness reigning at such
vast altitudes, and the natural conceit of what a fearfulness it
would be to lose oneself in such inhuman solitudes.  Much the same is
it with the backwoodsman of the West, who with comparative
indifference views an unbounded prairie sheeted with driven snow, no
shadow of tree or twig to break the fixed trance of whiteness.  Not
so the sailor, beholding the scenery of the Antarctic seas; where at
times, by some infernal trick of legerdemain in the powers of frost
and air, he, shivering and half shipwrecked, instead of rainbows
speaking hope and solace to his misery, views what seems a boundless
churchyard grinning upon him with its lean ice monuments and
splintered crosses.

But thou sayest, methinks that white-lead chapter about whiteness is
but a white flag hung out from a craven soul; thou surrenderest to a
hypo, Ishmael.

Tell me, why this strong young colt, foaled in some peaceful valley
of Vermont, far removed from all beasts of prey--why is it that upon
the sunniest day, if you but shake a fresh buffalo robe behind him,
so that he cannot even see it, but only smells its wild animal
muskiness--why will he start, snort, and with bursting eyes paw the
ground in phrensies of affright?  There is no remembrance in him of
any gorings of wild creatures in his green northern home, so that the
strange muskiness he smells cannot recall to him anything associated
with the experience of former perils; for what knows he, this New
England colt, of the black bisons of distant Oregon?

No; but here thou beholdest even in a dumb brute, the instinct of the
knowledge of the demonism in the world.  Though thousands of miles
from Oregon, still when he smells that savage musk, the rending,
goring bison herds are as present as to the deserted wild foal of the
prairies, which this instant they may be trampling into dust.

Thus, then, the muffled rollings of a milky sea; the bleak rustlings
of the festooned frosts of mountains; the desolate shiftings of the
windrowed snows of prairies; all these, to Ishmael, are as the
shaking of that buffalo robe to the frightened colt!

Though neither knows where lie the nameless things of which the
mystic sign gives forth such hints; yet with me, as with the colt,
somewhere those things must exist.  Though in many of its aspects
this visible world seems formed in love, the invisible spheres were
formed in fright.

But not yet have we solved the incantation of this whiteness, and
learned why it appeals with such power to the soul; and more strange
and far more portentous--why, as we have seen, it is at once the most
meaning symbol of spiritual things, nay, the very veil of the
Christian's Deity; and yet should be as it is, the intensifying agent
in things the most appalling to mankind.

Is it that by its indefiniteness it shadows forth the heartless voids
and immensities of the universe, and thus stabs us from behind with
the thought of annihilation, when beholding the white depths of the
milky way?  Or is it, that as in essence whiteness is not so much a
colour as the visible absence of colour; and at the same time the
concrete of all colours; is it for these reasons that there is such a
dumb blankness, full of meaning, in a wide landscape of snows--a
colourless, all-colour of atheism from which we shrink?  And when we
consider that other theory of the natural philosophers, that all
other earthly hues--every stately or lovely emblazoning--the sweet
tinges of sunset skies and woods; yea, and the gilded velvets of
butterflies, and the butterfly cheeks of young girls; all these are
but subtile deceits, not actually inherent in substances, but only
laid on from without; so that all deified Nature absolutely paints
like the harlot, whose allurements cover nothing but the
charnel-house within; and when we proceed further, and consider that
the mystical cosmetic which produces every one of her hues, the great
principle of light, for ever remains white or colourless in itself,
and if operating without medium upon matter, would touch all objects,
even tulips and roses, with its own blank tinge--pondering all this,
the palsied universe lies before us a leper; and like wilful
travellers in Lapland, who refuse to wear coloured and colouring
glasses upon their eyes, so the wretched infidel gazes himself blind
at the monumental white shroud that wraps all the prospect around
him.  And of all these things the Albino whale was the symbol.
Wonder ye then at the fiery hunt?



CHAPTER 43

Hark!


HIST!  Did you hear that noise, Cabaco?"
3360	
3361	It was the middle-watch; a fair moonlight; the seamen were standing
3362	in a cordon, extending from one of the fresh-water butts in the
3363	waist, to the scuttle-butt near the taffrail.  In this manner, they
3364	passed the buckets to fill the scuttle-butt.  Standing, for the most
3365	part, on the hallowed precincts of the quarter-deck, they were
3366	careful not to speak or rustle their feet.  From hand to hand, the
3367	buckets went in the deepest silence, only broken by the occasional
3368	flap of a sail, and the steady hum of the unceasingly advancing keel.
3369	
3370	It was in the midst of this repose, that Archy, one of the cordon,
3371	whose post was near the after-hatches, whispered to his neighbor, a
3372	Cholo, the words above.
3373	
3374	Hist! did you hear that noise, Cabaco?
3375	
3376	Take the bucket, will ye, Archy? what noise d'ye mean?
3377	
3378	"There it is again--under the hatches--don't you hear it--a cough--it
sounded like a cough."
3379	
3380	Cough be damned!  Pass along that return bucket.
3381	
3382	"There again--there it is!--it sounds like two or three sleepers
turning over, now!"
3383	
3384	"Caramba! have done, shipmate, will ye?  It's the three soaked
biscuits ye eat for supper turning over inside of ye--nothing else.
Look to the bucket!"
3385	
3386	Say what ye will, shipmate; I've sharp ears.
3387	
3388	"Aye, you are the chap, ain't ye, that heard the hum of the old
Quakeress's knitting-needles fifty miles at sea from Nantucket;
you're the chap."
3389	
3390	"Grin away; we'll see what turns up.  Hark ye, Cabaco, there is
somebody down in the after-hold that has not yet been seen on deck;
and I suspect our old Mogul knows something of it too.  I heard Stubb
tell Flask, one morning watch, that there was something of that sort
in the wind."
3391	
3392	Tish! the bucket!
3393	
3394	
3395	
3396	CHAPTER 44
3397	
3398	The Chart.
3399	
3400	
3401	Had you followed Captain Ahab down into his cabin after the squall
3402	that took place on the night succeeding that wild ratification of his
3403	purpose with his crew, you would have seen him go to a locker in the
3404	transom, and bringing out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish sea
3405	charts, spread them before him on his screwed-down table.  Then
3406	seating himself before it, you would have seen him intently study the
3407	various lines and shadings which there met his eye; and with slow but
3408	steady pencil trace additional courses over spaces that before were
3409	blank.  At intervals, he would refer to piles of old log-books beside
3410	him, wherein were set down the seasons and places in which, on
3411	various former voyages of various ships, sperm whales had been
3412	captured or seen.
3413	
3414	While thus employed, the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chains over
3415	his head, continually rocked with the motion of the ship, and for
3416	ever threw shifting gleams and shadows of lines upon his wrinkled
3417	brow, till it almost seemed that while he himself was marking out
3418	lines and courses on the wrinkled charts, some invisible pencil was
3419	also tracing lines and courses upon the deeply marked chart of his
3420	forehead.
3421	
3422	But it was not this night in particular that, in the solitude of his
3423	cabin, Ahab thus pondered over his charts.  Almost every night they
3424	were brought out; almost every night some pencil marks were effaced,
3425	and others were substituted.  For with the charts of all four oceans
3426	before him, Ahab was threading a maze of currents and eddies, with a
3427	view to the more certain accomplishment of that monomaniac thought of
3428	his soul.
3429	
3430	Now, to any one not fully acquainted with the ways of the leviathans,
3431	it might seem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out one solitary
3432	creature in the unhooped oceans of this planet.  But not so did it
3433	seem to Ahab, who knew the sets of all tides and currents; and
3434	thereby calculating the driftings of the sperm whale's food; and,
3435	also, calling to mind the regular, ascertained seasons for hunting
3436	him in particular latitudes; could arrive at reasonable surmises,
3437	almost approaching to certainties, concerning the timeliest day to be
3438	upon this or that ground in search of his prey.
3439	
3440	So assured, indeed, is the fact concerning the periodicalness of the
3441	sperm whale's resorting to given waters, that many hunters believe
3442	that, could he be closely observed and studied throughout the world;
3443	were the logs for one voyage of the entire whale fleet carefully
3444	collated, then the migrations of the sperm whale would be found to
3445	correspond in invariability to those of the herring-shoals or the
3446	flights of swallows.  On this hint, attempts have been made to
3447	construct elaborate migratory charts of the sperm whale.*
3448	
3449	
3450	*Since the above was written, the statement is happily borne out by
3451	an official circular, issued by Lieutenant Maury, of the National
3452	Observatory, Washington, April 16th, 1851.  By that circular, it
3453	appears that precisely such a chart is in course of completion; and
3454	"portions of it are presented in the circular.  This chart divides
the ocean into districts of five degrees of latitude by five degrees
of longitude; perpendicularly through each of which districts are
twelve columns for the twelve months; and horizontally through each
of which districts are three lines; one to show the number of days
that have been spent in each month in every district, and the two
others to show the number of days in which whales, sperm or right,
have been seen."
3455	
3456	
3457	Besides, when making a passage from one feeding-ground to another,
3458	the sperm whales, guided by some infallible instinct--say, rather,
3459	secret intelligence from the Deity--mostly swim in VEINS, as they are
3460	called; continuing their way along a given ocean-line with such
3461	undeviating exactitude, that no ship ever sailed her course, by any
3462	chart, with one tithe of such marvellous precision.  Though, in these
3463	cases, the direction taken by any one whale be straight as a
3464	surveyor's parallel, and though the line of advance be strictly
3465	confined to its own unavoidable, straight wake, yet the arbitrary
3466	VEIN in which at these times he is said to swim, generally embraces
3467	some few miles in width (more or less, as the vein is presumed to
3468	expand or contract); but never exceeds the visual sweep from the
3469	whale-ship's mast-heads, when circumspectly gliding along this magic
3470	zone.  The sum is, that at particular seasons within that breadth and
3471	along that path, migrating whales may with great confidence be looked
3472	for.
3473	
3474	And hence not only at substantiated times, upon well known separate
3475	feeding-grounds, could Ahab hope to encounter his prey; but in
3476	crossing the widest expanses of water between those grounds he could,
3477	by his art, so place and time himself on his way, as even then not to
3478	be wholly without prospect of a meeting.
3479	
3480	There was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his
3481	delirious but still methodical scheme.  But not so in the reality,
3482	perhaps.  Though the gregarious sperm whales have their regular
3483	seasons for particular grounds, yet in general you cannot conclude
3484	that the herds which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude
3485	this year, say, will turn out to be identically the same with those
3486	that were found there the preceding season; though there are peculiar
3487	and unquestionable instances where the contrary of this has proved
3488	true.  In general, the same remark, only within a less wide limit,
3489	applies to the solitaries and hermits among the matured, aged sperm
3490	whales.  So that though Moby Dick had in a former year been seen, for
3491	example, on what is called the Seychelle ground in the Indian ocean,
3492	or Volcano Bay on the Japanese Coast; yet it did not follow, that
3493	were the Pequod to visit either of those spots at any subsequent
3494	corresponding season, she would infallibly encounter him there.  So,
3495	too, with some other feeding grounds, where he had at times revealed
3496	himself.  But all these seemed only his casual stopping-places and
3497	ocean-inns, so to speak, not his places of prolonged abode.  And
3498	where Ahab's chances of accomplishing his object have hitherto been
3499	spoken of, allusion has only been made to whatever way-side,
3500	antecedent, extra prospects were his, ere a particular set time or
3501	place were attained, when all possibilities would become
3502	probabilities, and, as Ahab fondly thought, every possibility the
3503	next thing to a certainty.  That particular set time and place were
3504	conjoined in the one technical phrase--the Season-on-the-Line.  For
3505	there and then, for several consecutive years, Moby Dick had been
3506	periodically descried, lingering in those waters for awhile, as the
3507	sun, in its annual round, loiters for a predicted interval in any one
3508	sign of the Zodiac.  There it was, too, that most of the deadly
3509	encounters with the white whale had taken place; there the waves were
3510	storied with his deeds; there also was that tragic spot where the
3511	monomaniac old man had found the awful motive to his vengeance.  But
3512	in the cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering vigilance with
3513	which Ahab threw his brooding soul into this unfaltering hunt, he
3514	would not permit himself to rest all his hopes upon the one crowning
3515	fact above mentioned, however flattering it might be to those hopes;
3516	nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize his
3517	unquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest.
3518	
3519	Now, the Pequod had sailed from Nantucket at the very beginning of
3520	the Season-on-the-Line.  No possible endeavor then could enable her
3521	commander to make the great passage southwards, double Cape Horn, and
3522	then running down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial
3523	Pacific in time to cruise there.  Therefore, he must wait for the
3524	next ensuing season.  Yet the premature hour of the Pequod's sailing
3525	had, perhaps, been correctly selected by Ahab, with a view to this
3526	very complexion of things.  Because, an interval of three hundred and
3527	sixty-five days and nights was before him; an interval which, instead
3528	of impatiently enduring ashore, he would spend in a miscellaneous
3529	hunt; if by chance the White Whale, spending his vacation in seas far
3530	remote from his periodical feeding-grounds, should turn up his
3531	wrinkled brow off the Persian Gulf, or in the Bengal Bay, or China
3532	Seas, or in any other waters haunted by his race.  So that Monsoons,
3533	Pampas, Nor'-Westers, Harmattans, Trades; any wind but the Levanter
3534	and Simoon, might blow Moby Dick into the devious zig-zag
3535	world-circle of the Pequod's circumnavigating wake.
3536	
3537	But granting all this; yet, regarded discreetly and coolly, seems it
3538	not but a mad idea, this; that in the broad boundless ocean, one
3539	solitary whale, even if encountered, should be thought capable of
3540	individual recognition from his hunter, even as a white-bearded Mufti
3541	in the thronged thoroughfares of Constantinople?  Yes.  For the
3542	peculiar snow-white brow of Moby Dick, and his snow-white hump, could
3543	not but be unmistakable.  And have I not tallied the whale, Ahab
3544	would mutter to himself, as after poring over his charts till long
3545	after midnight he would throw himself back in reveries--tallied him,
3546	and shall he escape?  His broad fins are bored, and scalloped out
3547	like a lost sheep's ear!  And here, his mad mind would run on in a
3548	breathless race; till a weariness and faintness of pondering came
3549	over him; and in the open air of the deck he would seek to recover
3550	his strength.  Ah, God! what trances of torments does that man endure
3551	who is consumed with one unachieved revengeful desire.  He sleeps
3552	with clenched hands; and wakes with his own bloody nails in his
3553	palms.
3554	
3555	Often, when forced from his hammock by exhausting and intolerably
3556	vivid dreams of the night, which, resuming his own intense thoughts
3557	through the day, carried them on amid a clashing of phrensies, and
3558	whirled them round and round and round in his blazing brain, till
3559	the very throbbing of his life-spot became insufferable anguish; and
3560	when, as was sometimes the case, these spiritual throes in him heaved
3561	his being up from its base, and a chasm seemed opening in him, from
3562	which forked flames and lightnings shot up, and accursed fiends
3563	beckoned him to leap down among them; when this hell in himself
3564	yawned beneath him, a wild cry would be heard through the ship; and
3565	with glaring eyes Ahab would burst from his state room, as though
3566	escaping from a bed that was on fire.  Yet these, perhaps, instead of
3567	being the unsuppressable symptoms of some latent weakness, or fright
3568	at his own resolve, were but the plainest tokens of its intensity.
3569	For, at such times, crazy Ahab, the scheming, unappeasedly steadfast
3570	hunter of the white whale; this Ahab that had gone to his hammock,
3571	was not the agent that so caused him to burst from it in horror
3572	again.  The latter was the eternal, living principle or soul in him;
3573	and in sleep, being for the time dissociated from the characterizing
3574	mind, which at other times employed it for its outer vehicle or
3575	agent, it spontaneously sought escape from the scorching contiguity
3576	of the frantic thing, of which, for the time, it was no longer an
3577	integral.  But as the mind does not exist unless leagued with the
3578	soul, therefore it must have been that, in Ahab's case, yielding up
3579	all his thoughts and fancies to his one supreme purpose; that
3580	purpose, by its own sheer inveteracy of will, forced itself against
3581	gods and devils into a kind of self-assumed, independent being of its
3582	own.  Nay, could grimly live and burn, while the common vitality to
3583	which it was conjoined, fled horror-stricken from the unbidden and
3584	unfathered birth.  Therefore, the tormented spirit that glared out of
3585	bodily eyes, when what seemed Ahab rushed from his room, was for the
3586	time but a vacated thing, a formless somnambulistic being, a ray of
3587	living light, to be sure, but without an object to colour, and
3588	therefore a blankness in itself.  God help thee, old man, thy
3589	thoughts have created a creature in thee; and he whose intense
3590	thinking thus makes him a Prometheus; a vulture feeds upon that heart
3591	for ever; that vulture the very creature he creates.

3594	
3595	CHAPTER 45
3596	
3597	The Affidavit.
3598	
3599	
3600	So far as what there may be of a narrative in this book; and, indeed,
3601	as indirectly touching one or two very interesting and curious
3602	particulars in the habits of sperm whales, the foregoing chapter, in
3603	its earlier part, is as important a one as will be found in this
3604	volume; but the leading matter of it requires to be still further and
3605	more familiarly enlarged upon, in order to be adequately understood,
3606	and moreover to take away any incredulity which a profound ignorance
3607	of the entire subject may induce in some minds, as to the natural
3608	verity of the main points of this affair.
3609	
3610	I care not to perform this part of my task methodically; but shall be
3611	content to produce the desired impression by separate citations of
3612	items, practically or reliably known to me as a whaleman; and from
3613	these citations, I take it--the conclusion aimed at will naturally
3614	follow of itself.
3615	
3616	First: I have personally known three instances where a whale, after
3617	receiving a harpoon, has effected a complete escape; and, after an
3618	interval (in one instance of three years), has been again struck by
3619	the same hand, and slain; when the two irons, both marked by the same
3620	private cypher, have been taken from the body.  In the instance where
3621	three years intervened between the flinging of the two harpoons; and
3622	I think it may have been something more than that; the man who darted
3623	them happening, in the interval, to go in a trading ship on a voyage
3624	to Africa, went ashore there, joined a discovery party, and
3625	penetrated far into the interior, where he travelled for a period of
3626	nearly two years, often endangered by serpents, savages, tigers,
3627	poisonous miasmas, with all the other common perils incident to
3628	wandering in the heart of unknown regions.  Meanwhile, the whale he
3629	had struck must also have been on its travels; no doubt it had thrice
3630	circumnavigated the globe, brushing with its flanks all the coasts of
3631	Africa; but to no purpose.  This man and this whale again came
3632	together, and the one vanquished the other.  I say I, myself, have
3633	known three instances similar to this; that is in two of them I saw
3634	the whales struck; and, upon the second attack, saw the two irons
3635	with the respective marks cut in them, afterwards taken from the dead
3636	fish.  In the three-year instance, it so fell out that I was in the
3637	boat both times, first and last, and the last time distinctly
3638	recognised a peculiar sort of huge mole under the whale's eye, which
3639	I had observed there three years previous.  I say three years, but I
3640	am pretty sure it was more than that.  Here are three instances,
3641	then, which I personally know the truth of; but I have heard of many
3642	other instances from persons whose veracity in the matter there is no
3643	good ground to impeach.
3644	
3645	Secondly: It is well known in the Sperm Whale Fishery, however
3646	ignorant the world ashore may be of it, that there have been several
3647	memorable historical instances where a particular whale in the ocean
3648	has been at distant times and places popularly cognisable.  Why such
3649	a whale became thus marked was not altogether and originally owing to
3650	his bodily peculiarities as distinguished from other whales; for
3651	however peculiar in that respect any chance whale may be, they soon
3652	put an end to his peculiarities by killing him, and boiling him down
3653	into a peculiarly valuable oil.  No: the reason was this: that from
3654	the fatal experiences of the fishery there hung a terrible prestige
3655	of perilousness about such a whale as there did about Rinaldo
3656	Rinaldini, insomuch that most fishermen were content to recognise him
3657	by merely touching their tarpaulins when he would be discovered
3658	lounging by them on the sea, without seeking to cultivate a more
3659	intimate acquaintance.  Like some poor devils ashore that happen to
3660	know an irascible great man, they make distant unobtrusive
3661	salutations to him in the street, lest if they pursued the
3662	acquaintance further, they might receive a summary thump for their
3663	presumption.
3664	
3665	But not only did each of these famous whales enjoy great individual
3666	celebrity--Nay, you may call it an ocean-wide renown; not only was he
3667	famous in life and now is immortal in forecastle stories after death,
3668	but he was admitted into all the rights, privileges, and distinctions
3669	of a name; had as much a name indeed as Cambyses or Caesar.  Was it
3670	not so, O Timor Tom! thou famed leviathan, scarred like an iceberg,
3671	who so long did'st lurk in the Oriental straits of that name, whose
3672	spout was oft seen from the palmy beach of Ombay?  Was it not so, O
3673	New Zealand Jack! thou terror of all cruisers that crossed their
3674	wakes in the vicinity of the Tattoo Land?  Was it not so, O Morquan!
3675	King of Japan, whose lofty jet they say at times assumed the
3676	semblance of a snow-white cross against the sky?  Was it not so, O
3677	Don Miguel! thou Chilian whale, marked like an old tortoise with
3678	mystic hieroglyphics upon the back!  In plain prose, here are four
3679	whales as well known to the students of Cetacean History as Marius or
3680	Sylla to the classic scholar.
3681	
3682	But this is not all.  New Zealand Tom and Don Miguel, after at
3683	various times creating great havoc among the boats of different
3684	vessels, were finally gone in quest of, systematically hunted out,
3685	chased and killed by valiant whaling captains, who heaved up their
3686	anchors with that express object as much in view, as in setting out
3687	through the Narragansett Woods, Captain Butler of old had it in his
3688	mind to capture that notorious murderous savage Annawon, the headmost
3689	warrior of the Indian King Philip.
3690	
3691	I do not know where I can find a better place than just here, to make
3692	mention of one or two other things, which to me seem important, as in
3693	printed form establishing in all respects the reasonableness of the
3694	whole story of the White Whale, more especially the catastrophe.  For
3695	this is one of those disheartening instances where truth requires
3696	full as much bolstering as error.  So ignorant are most landsmen of
3697	some of the plainest and most palpable wonders of the world, that
3698	without some hints touching the plain facts, historical and
3699	otherwise, of the fishery, they might scout at Moby Dick as a
3700	monstrous fable, or still worse and more detestable, a hideous and
3701	intolerable allegory.
3702	
3703	First: Though most men have some vague flitting ideas of the general
3704	perils of the grand fishery, yet they have nothing like a fixed,
3705	vivid conception of those perils, and the frequency with which they
3706	recur.  One reason perhaps is, that not one in fifty of the actual
3707	disasters and deaths by casualties in the fishery, ever finds a
3708	public record at home, however transient and immediately forgotten
3709	that record.  Do you suppose that that poor fellow there, who this
3710	moment perhaps caught by the whale-line off the coast of New Guinea,
3711	is being carried down to the bottom of the sea by the sounding
3712	leviathan--do you suppose that that poor fellow's name will appear in
3713	the newspaper obituary you will read to-morrow at your breakfast?
3714	No: because the mails are very irregular between here and New Guinea.
3715	In fact, did you ever hear what might be called regular news direct
3716	or indirect from New Guinea?  Yet I tell you that upon one particular
3717	voyage which I made to the Pacific, among many others we spoke thirty
3718	different ships, every one of which had had a death by a whale, some
3719	of them more than one, and three that had each lost a boat's crew.
3720	For God's sake, be economical with your lamps and candles! not a
3721	gallon you burn, but at least one drop of man's blood was spilled for
3722	it.
3723	
3724	Secondly: People ashore have indeed some indefinite idea that a whale
3725	is an enormous creature of enormous power; but I have ever found that
3726	when narrating to them some specific example of this two-fold
3727	enormousness, they have significantly complimented me upon my
3728	facetiousness; when, I declare upon my soul, I had no more idea of
3729	being facetious than Moses, when he wrote the history of the plagues
3730	of Egypt.
3731	
3732	But fortunately the special point I here seek can be established upon
3733	testimony entirely independent of my own.  That point is this: The
3734	Sperm Whale is in some cases sufficiently powerful, knowing, and
3735	judiciously malicious, as with direct aforethought to stave in,
3736	utterly destroy, and sink a large ship; and what is more, the Sperm
3737	Whale HAS done it.
3738	
3739	First: In the year 1820 the ship Essex, Captain Pollard, of
3740	Nantucket, was cruising in the Pacific Ocean.  One day she saw
3741	spouts, lowered her boats, and gave chase to a shoal of sperm whales.
3742	Ere long, several of the whales were wounded; when, suddenly, a very
3743	large whale escaping from the boats, issued from the shoal, and bore
3744	directly down upon the ship.  Dashing his forehead against her hull,
3745	he so stove her in, that in less than ten minutes she settled down
3746	and fell over.  Not a surviving plank of her has been seen since.
3747	After the severest exposure, part of the crew reached the land in
3748	their boats.  Being returned home at last, Captain Pollard once more
3749	sailed for the Pacific in command of another ship, but the gods
3750	shipwrecked him again upon unknown rocks and breakers; for the second
3751	time his ship was utterly lost, and forthwith forswearing the sea, he
3752	has never tempted it since.  At this day Captain Pollard is a
3753	resident of Nantucket.  I have seen Owen Chace, who was chief mate of
3754	the Essex at the time of the tragedy; I have read his plain and
3755	faithful narrative; I have conversed with his son; and all this
3756	within a few miles of the scene of the catastrophe.*
3757	
3758	
3759	"*The following are extracts from Chace's narrative: Every fact
seemed to warrant me in concluding that it was anything but chance
which directed his operations; he made two several attacks upon the
ship, at a short interval between them, both of which, according to
their direction, were calculated to do us the most injury, by being
made ahead, and thereby combining the speed of the two objects for
the shock; to effect which, the exact manoeuvres which he made were
necessary.  His aspect was most horrible, and such as indicated
resentment and fury.  He came directly from the shoal which we had
just before entered, and in which we had struck three of his
companions, as if fired with revenge for their sufferings.  Again:"
3760	"At all events, the whole circumstances taken together, all happening
before my own eyes, and producing, at the time, impressions in my
mind of decided, calculating mischief, on the part of the whale (many
of which impressions I cannot now recall), induce me to be satisfied
that I am correct in my opinion."
3761	
3762	Here are his reflections some time after quitting the ship, during a
3763	black night an open boat, when almost despairing of reaching any
3764	"hospitable shore.  The dark ocean and swelling waters were nothing;
the fears of being swallowed up by some dreadful tempest, or dashed
upon hidden rocks, with all the other ordinary subjects of fearful
contemplation, seemed scarcely entitled to a moment's thought; the
dismal looking wreck, and THE HORRID ASPECT AND REVENGE OF THE WHALE,
wholly engrossed my reflections, until day again made its
appearance."
3765	
3766	"In another place--p. 45,--he speaks of THE MYSTERIOUS AND MORTAL
ATTACK OF THE ANIMAL."
3767	
3768	
3769	Secondly: The ship Union, also of Nantucket, was in the year 1807
3770	totally lost off the Azores by a similar onset, but the authentic
3771	particulars of this catastrophe I have never chanced to encounter,
3772	though from the whale hunters I have now and then heard casual
3773	allusions to it.
3774	
3775	Thirdly: Some eighteen or twenty years ago Commodore J---, then
3776	commanding an American sloop-of-war of the first class, happened to
3777	be dining with a party of whaling captains, on board a Nantucket ship
3778	in the harbor of Oahu, Sandwich Islands.  Conversation turning upon
3779	whales, the Commodore was pleased to be sceptical touching the
3780	amazing strength ascribed to them by the professional gentlemen
3781	present.  He peremptorily denied for example, that any whale could so
3782	smite his stout sloop-of-war as to cause her to leak so much as a
3783	thimbleful.  Very good; but there is more coming.  Some weeks after,
3784	the Commodore set sail in this impregnable craft for Valparaiso.  But
3785	he was stopped on the way by a portly sperm whale, that begged a few
3786	moments' confidential business with him.  That business consisted in
3787	fetching the Commodore's craft such a thwack, that with all his pumps
3788	going he made straight for the nearest port to heave down and repair.
3789	I am not superstitious, but I consider the Commodore's interview
3790	with that whale as providential.  Was not Saul of Tarsus converted
3791	from unbelief by a similar fright?  I tell you, the sperm whale will
3792	stand no nonsense.
3793	
3794	I will now refer you to Langsdorff's Voyages for a little
3795	circumstance in point, peculiarly interesting to the writer hereof.
3796	Langsdorff, you must know by the way, was attached to the Russian
3797	Admiral Krusenstern's famous Discovery Expedition in the beginning of
3798	the present century.  Captain Langsdorff thus begins his seventeenth
3799	chapter:
3800	
3801	"By the thirteenth of May our ship was ready to sail, and the next
day we were out in the open sea, on our way to Ochotsh.  The weather
was very clear and fine, but so intolerably cold that we were obliged
to keep on our fur clothing.  For some days we had very little wind;
it was not till the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwest
sprang up.  An uncommon large whale, the body of which was larger
than the ship itself, lay almost at the surface of the water, but was
not perceived by any one on board till the moment when the ship,
which was in full sail, was almost upon him, so that it was
impossible to prevent its striking against him.  We were thus placed
in the most imminent danger, as this gigantic creature, setting up
its back, raised the ship three feet at least out of the water.  The
masts reeled, and the sails fell altogether, while we who were below
all sprang instantly upon the deck, concluding that we had struck
upon some rock; instead of this we saw the monster sailing off with
the utmost gravity and solemnity.  Captain D'Wolf applied immediately
to the pumps to examine whether or not the vessel had received any
damage from the shock, but we found that very happily it had escaped
entirely uninjured."
3802	
3803	Now, the Captain D'Wolf here alluded to as commanding the ship in
3804	question, is a New Englander, who, after a long life of unusual
3805	adventures as a sea-captain, this day resides in the village of
3806	Dorchester near Boston.  I have the honour of being a nephew of his.
3807	I have particularly questioned him concerning this passage in
3808	Langsdorff.  He substantiates every word.  The ship, however, was by
3809	no means a large one: a Russian craft built on the Siberian coast,
3810	and purchased by my uncle after bartering away the vessel in which he
3811	sailed from home.
3812	
3813	In that up and down manly book of old-fashioned adventure, so full,
3814	too, of honest wonders--the voyage of Lionel Wafer, one of ancient
3815	Dampier's old chums--I found a little matter set down so like that
3816	just quoted from Langsdorff, that I cannot forbear inserting it here
3817	for a corroborative example, if such be needed.
3818	
3819	Lionel, it seems, was on his way to John Ferdinando, as he calls
3820	"the modern Juan Fernandes.  In our way thither, he says, about
four o'clock in the morning, when we were about one hundred and fifty
leagues from the Main of America, our ship felt a terrible shock,
which put our men in such consternation that they could hardly tell
where they were or what to think; but every one began to prepare for
death.  And, indeed, the shock was so sudden and violent, that we
took it for granted the ship had struck against a rock; but when the
amazement was a little over, we cast the lead, and sounded, but found
no ground.  ....  The suddenness of the shock made the guns leap in
their carriages, and several of the men were shaken out of their
hammocks.  Captain Davis, who lay with his head on a gun, was thrown
out of his cabin!  Lionel then goes on to impute the shock to an"
3821	earthquake, and seems to substantiate the imputation by stating that
3822	a great earthquake, somewhere about that time, did actually do great
3823	mischief along the Spanish land.  But I should not much wonder if, in
3824	the darkness of that early hour of the morning, the shock was after
3825	all caused by an unseen whale vertically bumping the hull from
3826	beneath.
3827	
3828	I might proceed with several more examples, one way or another known
3829	to me, of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale.  In
3830	more than one instance, he has been known, not only to chase the
3831	assailing boats back to their ships, but to pursue the ship itself,
3832	and long withstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks.  The
3833	English ship Pusie Hall can tell a story on that head; and, as for
3834	his strength, let me say, that there have been examples where the
3835	lines attached to a running sperm whale have, in a calm, been
3836	transferred to the ship, and secured there; the whale towing her
3837	great hull through the water, as a horse walks off with a cart.
3838	Again, it is very often observed that, if the sperm whale, once
3839	struck, is allowed time to rally, he then acts, not so often with
3840	blind rage, as with wilful, deliberate designs of destruction to his
3841	pursuers; nor is it without conveying some eloquent indication of his
3842	character, that upon being attacked he will frequently open his
3843	mouth, and retain it in that dread expansion for several consecutive
3844	minutes.  But I must be content with only one more and a concluding
3845	illustration; a remarkable and most significant one, by which you
3846	will not fail to see, that not only is the most marvellous event in
3847	this book corroborated by plain facts of the present day, but that
3848	these marvels (like all marvels) are mere repetitions of the ages; so
3849	that for the millionth time we say amen with Solomon--Verily there is
3850	nothing new under the sun.
3851	
3852	In the sixth Christian century lived Procopius, a Christian
3853	magistrate of Constantinople, in the days when Justinian was Emperor
3854	and Belisarius general.  As many know, he wrote the history of his
3855	own times, a work every way of uncommon value.  By the best
3856	authorities, he has always been considered a most trustworthy and
3857	unexaggerating historian, except in some one or two particulars, not
3858	at all affecting the matter presently to be mentioned.
3859	
3860	Now, in this history of his, Procopius mentions that, during the term
3861	of his prefecture at Constantinople, a great sea-monster was captured
3862	in the neighboring Propontis, or Sea of Marmora, after having
3863	destroyed vessels at intervals in those waters for a period of more
3864	than fifty years.  A fact thus set down in substantial history cannot
3865	easily be gainsaid.  Nor is there any reason it should be.  Of what
3866	precise species this sea-monster was, is not mentioned.  But as he
3867	destroyed ships, as well as for other reasons, he must have been a
3868	whale; and I am strongly inclined to think a sperm whale.  And I will
3869	tell you why.  For a long time I fancied that the sperm whale had
3870	been always unknown in the Mediterranean and the deep waters
3871	connecting with it.  Even now I am certain that those seas are not,
3872	and perhaps never can be, in the present constitution of things, a
3873	place for his habitual gregarious resort.  But further investigations
3874	have recently proved to me, that in modern times there have been
3875	isolated instances of the presence of the sperm whale in the
3876	Mediterranean.  I am told, on good authority, that on the Barbary
3877	coast, a Commodore Davis of the British navy found the skeleton of a
3878	sperm whale.  Now, as a vessel of war readily passes through the
3879	Dardanelles, hence a sperm whale could, by the same route, pass out
3880	of the Mediterranean into the Propontis.
3881	
3882	In the Propontis, as far as I can learn, none of that peculiar
3883	substance called BRIT is to be found, the aliment of the right whale.
3884	But I have every reason to believe that the food of the sperm
3885	whale--squid or cuttle-fish--lurks at the bottom of that sea, because
3886	large creatures, but by no means the largest of that sort, have been
3887	found at its surface.  If, then, you properly put these statements
3888	together, and reason upon them a bit, you will clearly perceive that,
3889	according to all human reasoning, Procopius's sea-monster, that for
3890	half a century stove the ships of a Roman Emperor, must in all
3891	probability have been a sperm whale.

3897	Surmises.
3898	
3899	
3900	Though, consumed with the hot fire of his purpose, Ahab in all his
3901	thoughts and actions ever had in view the ultimate capture of Moby
3902	Dick; though he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal interests to
3903	that one passion; nevertheless it may have been that he was by nature
3904	and long habituation far too wedded to a fiery whaleman's ways,
3905	altogether to abandon the collateral prosecution of the voyage.  Or
3906	at least if this were otherwise, there were not wanting other motives
3907	much more influential with him.  It would be refining too much,
3908	perhaps, even considering his monomania, to hint that his
3909	vindictiveness towards the White Whale might have possibly extended
3910	itself in some degree to all sperm whales, and that the more monsters
3911	he slew by so much the more he multiplied the chances that each
3912	subsequently encountered whale would prove to be the hated one he
3913	hunted.  But if such an hypothesis be indeed exceptionable, there
3914	were still additional considerations which, though not so strictly
3915	according with the wildness of his ruling passion, yet were by no
3916	means incapable of swaying him.
3917	
3918	To accomplish his object Ahab must use tools; and of all tools used
3919	in the shadow of the moon, men are most apt to get out of order.  He
3920	knew, for example, that however magnetic his ascendency in some
3921	respects was over Starbuck, yet that ascendency did not cover the
3922	complete spiritual man any more than mere corporeal superiority
3923	involves intellectual mastership; for to the purely spiritual, the
3924	intellectual but stand in a sort of corporeal relation.  Starbuck's
3925	body and Starbuck's coerced will were Ahab's, so long as Ahab kept
3926	his magnet at Starbuck's brain; still he knew that for all this the
3927	chief mate, in his soul, abhorred his captain's quest, and could he,
3928	would joyfully disintegrate himself from it, or even frustrate it.
3929	It might be that a long interval would elapse ere the White Whale was
3930	seen.  During that long interval Starbuck would ever be apt to fall
3931	into open relapses of rebellion against his captain's leadership,
3932	unless some ordinary, prudential, circumstantial influences were
3933	brought to bear upon him.  Not only that, but the subtle insanity of
3934	Ahab respecting Moby Dick was noways more significantly manifested
3935	than in his superlative sense and shrewdness in foreseeing that, for
3936	the present, the hunt should in some way be stripped of that strange
3937	imaginative impiousness which naturally invested it; that the full
3938	terror of the voyage must be kept withdrawn into the obscure
3939	background (for few men's courage is proof against protracted
3940	meditation unrelieved by action); that when they stood their long
3941	night watches, his officers and men must have some nearer things to
3942	think of than Moby Dick.  For however eagerly and impetuously the
3943	savage crew had hailed the announcement of his quest; yet all sailors
3944	of all sorts are more or less capricious and unreliable--they live in
3945	the varying outer weather, and they inhale its fickleness--and when
3946	retained for any object remote and blank in the pursuit, however
3947	promissory of life and passion in the end, it is above all things
3948	requisite that temporary interests and employments should intervene
3949	and hold them healthily suspended for the final dash.
3950	
3951	Nor was Ahab unmindful of another thing.  In times of strong emotion
3952	mankind disdain all base considerations; but such times are
3953	evanescent.  The permanent constitutional condition of the
3954	manufactured man, thought Ahab, is sordidness.  Granting that the
3955	White Whale fully incites the hearts of this my savage crew, and
3956	playing round their savageness even breeds a certain generous
3957	knight-errantism in them, still, while for the love of it they give
3958	chase to Moby Dick, they must also have food for their more common,
3959	daily appetites.  For even the high lifted and chivalric Crusaders of
3960	old times were not content to traverse two thousand miles of land to
3961	fight for their holy sepulchre, without committing burglaries,
3962	picking pockets, and gaining other pious perquisites by the way.  Had
3963	they been strictly held to their one final and romantic object--that
3964	final and romantic object, too many would have turned from in
3965	disgust.  I will not strip these men, thought Ahab, of all hopes of
3966	cash--aye, cash.  They may scorn cash now; but let some months go by,
3967	and no perspective promise of it to them, and then this same
3968	quiescent cash all at once mutinying in them, this same cash would
3969	soon cashier Ahab.
3970	
3971	Nor was there wanting still another precautionary motive more related
3972	to Ahab personally.  Having impulsively, it is probable, and perhaps
3973	somewhat prematurely revealed the prime but private purpose of the
3974	Pequod's voyage, Ahab was now entirely conscious that, in so doing,
3975	he had indirectly laid himself open to the unanswerable charge of
3976	usurpation; and with perfect impunity, both moral and legal, his crew
3977	if so disposed, and to that end competent, could refuse all further
3978	obedience to him, and even violently wrest from him the command.
3979	From even the barely hinted imputation of usurpation, and the
3980	possible consequences of such a suppressed impression gaining ground,
3981	Ahab must of course have been most anxious to protect himself.  That
3982	protection could only consist in his own predominating brain and
3983	heart and hand, backed by a heedful, closely calculating attention to
3984	every minute atmospheric influence which it was possible for his crew
3985	to be subjected to.
3986	
3987	For all these reasons then, and others perhaps too analytic to be
3988	verbally developed here, Ahab plainly saw that he must still in a
3989	good degree continue true to the natural, nominal purpose of the
3990	Pequod's voyage; observe all customary usages; and not only that, but
3991	force himself to evince all his well known passionate interest in the
3992	general pursuit of his profession.
3993	
3994	Be all this as it may, his voice was now often heard hailing the
3995	three mast-heads and admonishing them to keep a bright look-out, and
3996	not omit reporting even a porpoise.  This vigilance was not long
3997	without reward.

4001	CHAPTER 47
4002	
4003	The Mat-Maker.
4004	
4005	
4006	It was a cloudy, sultry afternoon; the seamen were lazily lounging
4007	about the decks, or vacantly gazing over into the lead-coloured
4008	waters.  Queequeg and I were mildly employed weaving what is called a
4009	sword-mat, for an additional lashing to our boat.  So still and
4010	subdued and yet somehow preluding was all the scene, and such an
4011	incantation of reverie lurked in the air, that each silent sailor
4012	seemed resolved into his own invisible self.
4013	
4014	I was the attendant or page of Queequeg, while busy at the mat.  As I
4015	kept passing and repassing the filling or woof of marline between the
4016	long yarns of the warp, using my own hand for the shuttle, and as
4017	Queequeg, standing sideways, ever and anon slid his heavy oaken sword
4018	between the threads, and idly looking off upon the water, carelessly
4019	and unthinkingly drove home every yarn: I say so strange a
4020	dreaminess did there then reign all over the ship and all over the
4021	sea, only broken by the intermitting dull sound of the sword, that it
4022	seemed as if this were the Loom of Time, and I myself were a shuttle
4023	mechanically weaving and weaving away at the Fates.  There lay the
4024	fixed threads of the warp subject to but one single, ever returning,
4025	unchanging vibration, and that vibration merely enough to admit of
4026	the crosswise interblending of other threads with its own.  This warp
4027	seemed necessity; and here, thought I, with my own hand I ply my own
4028	shuttle and weave my own destiny into these unalterable threads.
4029	Meantime, Queequeg's impulsive, indifferent sword, sometimes hitting
4030	the woof slantingly, or crookedly, or strongly, or weakly, as the
4031	case might be; and by this difference in the concluding blow
4032	producing a corresponding contrast in the final aspect of the
4033	completed fabric; this savage's sword, thought I, which thus finally
4034	shapes and fashions both warp and woof; this easy, indifferent sword
4035	must be chance--aye, chance, free will, and necessity--nowise
4036	incompatible--all interweavingly working together.  The straight warp
4037	of necessity, not to be swerved from its ultimate course--its every
4038	alternating vibration, indeed, only tending to that; free will still
4039	free to ply her shuttle between given threads; and chance, though
4040	restrained in its play within the right lines of necessity, and
4041	sideways in its motions directed by free will, though thus prescribed
4042	to by both, chance by turns rules either, and has the last featuring
4043	blow at events.
4044	
4045	
4046	Thus we were weaving and weaving away when I started at a sound so
4047	strange, long drawn, and musically wild and unearthly, that the ball
4048	of free will dropped from my hand, and I stood gazing up at the
4049	clouds whence that voice dropped like a wing.  High aloft in the
4050	cross-trees was that mad Gay-Header, Tashtego.  His body was reaching
4051	eagerly forward, his hand stretched out like a wand, and at brief
4052	sudden intervals he continued his cries.  To be sure the same sound
4053	was that very moment perhaps being heard all over the seas, from
4054	hundreds of whalemen's look-outs perched as high in the air; but from
4055	few of those lungs could that accustomed old cry have derived such a
4056	marvellous cadence as from Tashtego the Indian's.
4057	
4058	As he stood hovering over you half suspended in air, so wildly and
4059	eagerly peering towards the horizon, you would have thought him some
4060	prophet or seer beholding the shadows of Fate, and by those wild
4061	cries announcing their coming.
4062	
4063	There she blows! there! there! there! she blows! she blows!
4064	
4065	Where-away?
4066	
4067	On the lee-beam, about two miles off! a school of them!
4068	
4069	Instantly all was commotion.
4070	
4071	The Sperm Whale blows as a clock ticks, with the same undeviating and
4072	reliable uniformity.  And thereby whalemen distinguish this fish from
4073	other tribes of his genus.
4074	
4075	There go flukes! was now the cry from Tashtego; and the whales
4076	disappeared.
4077	
4078	Quick, steward! cried Ahab.  Time! time!
4079	
4080	Dough-Boy hurried below, glanced at the watch, and reported the exact
4081	minute to Ahab.
4082	
4083	The ship was now kept away from the wind, and she went gently rolling
4084	before it.  Tashtego reporting that the whales had gone down heading
4085	to leeward, we confidently looked to see them again directly in
4086	advance of our bows.  For that singular craft at times evinced by the
4087	Sperm Whale when, sounding with his head in one direction, he
4088	nevertheless, while concealed beneath the surface, mills round, and
4089	swiftly swims off in the opposite quarter--this deceitfulness of his
4090	could not now be in action; for there was no reason to suppose that
4091	the fish seen by Tashtego had been in any way alarmed, or indeed knew
4092	at all of our vicinity.  One of the men selected for
4093	shipkeepers--that is, those not appointed to the boats, by this time
4094	relieved the Indian at the main-mast head.  The sailors at the fore
4095	and mizzen had come down; the line tubs were fixed in their places;
4096	the cranes were thrust out; the mainyard was backed, and the three
4097	boats swung over the sea like three samphire baskets over high
4098	cliffs.  Outside of the bulwarks their eager crews with one hand
4099	clung to the rail, while one foot was expectantly poised on the
4100	gunwale.  So look the long line of man-of-war's men about to throw
4101	themselves on board an enemy's ship.
4102	
4103	But at this critical instant a sudden exclamation was heard that took
4104	every eye from the whale.  With a start all glared at dark Ahab, who
4105	was surrounded by five dusky phantoms that seemed fresh formed out of
4106	air.
4107	
4108	
4109	
4110	CHAPTER 48
4111	
4112	The First Lowering.
4113	
4114	
4115	The phantoms, for so they then seemed, were flitting on the other
4116	side of the deck, and, with a noiseless celerity, were casting loose
4117	the tackles and bands of the boat which swung there.  This boat had
4118	always been deemed one of the spare boats, though technically called
4119	the captain's, on account of its hanging from the starboard quarter.
4120	The figure that now stood by its bows was tall and swart, with one
4121	white tooth evilly protruding from its steel-like lips.  A rumpled
4122	Chinese jacket of black cotton funereally invested him, with wide
4123	black trowsers of the same dark stuff.  But strangely crowning this
4124	ebonness was a glistening white plaited turban, the living hair
4125	braided and coiled round and round upon his head.  Less swart in
4126	aspect, the companions of this figure were of that vivid,
4127	tiger-yellow complexion peculiar to some of the aboriginal natives of
4128	the Manillas;--a race notorious for a certain diabolism of subtilty,
4129	and by some honest white mariners supposed to be the paid spies and
4130	secret confidential agents on the water of the devil, their lord,
4131	whose counting-room they suppose to be elsewhere.
4132	
4133	While yet the wondering ship's company were gazing upon these
4134	strangers, Ahab cried out to the white-turbaned old man at their
4135	head, All ready there, Fedallah?
4136	
4137	Ready, was the half-hissed reply.
4138	
4139	"Lower away then; d'ye hear? shouting across the deck.  Lower away
there, I say."
4140	
4141	Such was the thunder of his voice, that spite of their amazement the
4142	men sprang over the rail; the sheaves whirled round in the blocks;
4143	with a wallow, the three boats dropped into the sea; while, with a
4144	dexterous, off-handed daring, unknown in any other vocation, the
4145	sailors, goat-like, leaped down the rolling ship's side into the
4146	tossed boats below.
4147	
4148	Hardly had they pulled out from under the ship's lee, when a fourth
4149	keel, coming from the windward side, pulled round under the stern,
4150	and showed the five strangers rowing Ahab, who, standing erect in the
4151	stern, loudly hailed Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, to spread themselves
4152	widely, so as to cover a large expanse of water.  But with all their
4153	eyes again riveted upon the swart Fedallah and his crew, the inmates
4154	of the other boats obeyed not the command.
4155	
4156	Captain Ahab?-- said Starbuck.
4157	
4158	"Spread yourselves, cried Ahab; give way, all four boats.  Thou,
Flask, pull out more to leeward!"
4159	
4160	Aye, aye, sir, cheerily cried little King-Post, sweeping round his
4161	great steering oar.  Lay back! addressing his crew.
4162	"There!--there!--there again!  There she blows right ahead,
boys!--lay back!"
4163	
4164	Never heed yonder yellow boys, Archy.
4165	
4166	"Oh, I don't mind'em, sir, said Archy; I knew it all before now.
Didn't I hear 'em in the hold?  And didn't I tell Cabaco here of it?
What say ye, Cabaco?  They are stowaways, Mr. Flask."
4167	
4168	"Pull, pull, my fine hearts-alive; pull, my children; pull, my little
ones, drawlingly and soothingly sighed Stubb to his crew, some of"
4169	"whom still showed signs of uneasiness.  Why don't you break your
backbones, my boys?  What is it you stare at?  Those chaps in yonder
boat?  Tut!  They are only five more hands come to help us--never
mind from where--the more the merrier.  Pull, then, do pull; never
mind the brimstone--devils are good fellows enough.  So, so; there
you are now; that's the stroke for a thousand pounds; that's the
stroke to sweep the stakes!  Hurrah for the gold cup of sperm oil, my
heroes!  Three cheers, men--all hearts alive!  Easy, easy; don't be
in a hurry--don't be in a hurry.  Why don't you snap your oars, you
rascals?  Bite something, you dogs!  So, so, so, then:--softly,
softly!  That's it--that's it! long and strong.  Give way there, give
way!  The devil fetch ye, ye ragamuffin rapscallions; ye are all
asleep.  Stop snoring, ye sleepers, and pull.  Pull, will ye? pull,
can't ye? pull, won't ye?  Why in the name of gudgeons and
ginger-cakes don't ye pull?--pull and break something! pull, and
start your eyes out!  Here! whipping out the sharp knife from his"
4170	"girdle; every mother's son of ye draw his knife, and pull with the
blade between his teeth.  That's it--that's it.  Now ye do something;
that looks like it, my steel-bits.  Start her--start her, my
silver-spoons!  Start her, marling-spikes!"
4171	
4172	Stubb's exordium to his crew is given here at large, because he had
4173	rather a peculiar way of talking to them in general, and especially
4174	in inculcating the religion of rowing.  But you must not suppose from
4175	this specimen of his sermonizings that he ever flew into downright
4176	passions with his congregation.  Not at all; and therein consisted
4177	his chief peculiarity.  He would say the most terrific things to his
4178	crew, in a tone so strangely compounded of fun and fury, and the fury
4179	seemed so calculated merely as a spice to the fun, that no oarsman
4180	could hear such queer invocations without pulling for dear life, and
4181	yet pulling for the mere joke of the thing.  Besides he all the time
4182	looked so easy and indolent himself, so loungingly managed his
4183	steering-oar, and so broadly gaped--open-mouthed at times--that the
4184	mere sight of such a yawning commander, by sheer force of contrast,
4185	acted like a charm upon the crew.  Then again, Stubb was one of those
4186	odd sort of humorists, whose jollity is sometimes so curiously
4187	ambiguous, as to put all inferiors on their guard in the matter of
4188	obeying them.
4189	
4190	In obedience to a sign from Ahab, Starbuck was now pulling obliquely
4191	across Stubb's bow; and when for a minute or so the two boats were
4192	pretty near to each other, Stubb hailed the mate.
4193	
4194	"Mr. Starbuck! larboard boat there, ahoy! a word with ye, sir, if ye
please!"
4195	
4196	Halloa! returned Starbuck, turning round not a single inch as he
4197	spoke; still earnestly but whisperingly urging his crew; his face set
4198	like a flint from Stubb's.
4199	
4200	"What think ye of those yellow boys, sir!

Smuggled on board, somehow, before the ship sailed. (Strong, strong,"
4201	boys!) in a whisper to his crew, then speaking out loud again: A
4202	sad business, Mr. Stubb! (seethe her, seethe her, my lads!) but never
4203	mind, Mr. Stubb, all for the best.  Let all your crew pull strong,
4204	come what will. (Spring, my men, spring!) There's hogsheads of sperm
4205	ahead, Mr. Stubb, and that's what ye came for. (Pull, my boys!)
4206	Sperm, sperm's the play!  This at least is duty; duty and profit hand
4207	"in hand.

Aye, aye, I thought as much, soliloquized Stubb, when the boats
diverged, as soon as I clapt eye on 'em, I thought so.  Aye, and"
4208	that's what he went into the after hold for, so often, as Dough-Boy
4209	long suspected.  They were hidden down there.  The White Whale's at
4210	the bottom of it.  Well, well, so be it!  Can't be helped!  All
4211	"right!  Give way, men!  It ain't the White Whale to-day!  Give way!

Now the advent of these outlandish strangers at such a critical
instant as the lowering of the boats from the deck, this had not
unreasonably awakened a sort of superstitious amazement in some of
the ship's company; but Archy's fancied discovery having some time
previous got abroad among them, though indeed not credited then, this
had in some small measure prepared them for the event.  It took off
the extreme edge of their wonder; and so what with all this and
Stubb's confident way of accounting for their appearance, they were
for the time freed from superstitious surmisings; though the affair
still left abundant room for all manner of wild conjectures as to
dark Ahab's precise agency in the matter from the beginning.  For me,
I silently recalled the mysterious shadows I had seen creeping on
board the Pequod during the dim Nantucket dawn, as well as the
enigmatical hintings of the unaccountable Elijah.

Meantime, Ahab, out of hearing of his officers, having sided the
furthest to windward, was still ranging ahead of the other boats; a
circumstance bespeaking how potent a crew was pulling him.  Those
tiger yellow creatures of his seemed all steel and whalebone; like
five trip-hammers they rose and fell with regular strokes of
strength, which periodically started the boat along the water like a
horizontal burst boiler out of a Mississippi steamer.  As for
Fedallah, who was seen pulling the harpooneer oar, he had thrown
aside his black jacket, and displayed his naked chest with the whole
part of his body above the gunwale, clearly cut against the
alternating depressions of the watery horizon; while at the other end
of the boat Ahab, with one arm, like a fencer's, thrown half backward
into the air, as if to counterbalance any tendency to trip; Ahab was
seen steadily managing his steering oar as in a thousand boat
lowerings ere the White Whale had torn him.  All at once the
outstretched arm gave a peculiar motion and then remained fixed,
while the boat's five oars were seen simultaneously peaked.  Boat and
crew sat motionless on the sea.  Instantly the three spread boats in
the rear paused on their way.  The whales had irregularly settled
bodily down into the blue, thus giving no distantly discernible token
of the movement, though from his closer vicinity Ahab had observed
it.

Every man look out along his oars! cried Starbuck.  Thou,"
4212	"Queequeg, stand up!

Nimbly springing up on the triangular raised box in the bow, the
savage stood erect there, and with intensely eager eyes gazed off
towards the spot where the chase had last been descried.  Likewise
upon the extreme stern of the boat where it was also triangularly
platformed level with the gunwale, Starbuck himself was seen coolly
and adroitly balancing himself to the jerking tossings of his chip of
a craft, and silently eyeing the vast blue eye of the sea.

Not very far distant Flask's boat was also lying breathlessly still;
its commander recklessly standing upon the top of the loggerhead, a
stout sort of post rooted in the keel, and rising some two feet above
the level of the stern platform.  It is used for catching turns with
the whale line.  Its top is not more spacious than the palm of a
man's hand, and standing upon such a base as that, Flask seemed
perched at the mast-head of some ship which had sunk to all but her
trucks.  But little King-Post was small and short, and at the same
time little King-Post was full of a large and tall ambition, so that
this loggerhead stand-point of his did by no means satisfy King-Post.

I can't see three seas off; tip us up an oar there, and let me on to"
4213	"that.

Upon this, Daggoo, with either hand upon the gunwale to steady his
way, swiftly slid aft, and then erecting himself volunteered his
lofty shoulders for a pedestal.

Good a mast-head as any, sir.  Will you mount?

That I will, and thank ye very much, my fine fellow; only I wish you"
4214	"fifty feet taller.

Whereupon planting his feet firmly against two opposite planks of the
boat, the gigantic negro, stooping a little, presented his flat palm
to Flask's foot, and then putting Flask's hand on his hearse-plumed
head and bidding him spring as he himself should toss, with one
dexterous fling landed the little man high and dry on his shoulders.
And here was Flask now standing, Daggoo with one lifted arm
furnishing him with a breastband to lean against and steady himself
by.

At any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with what
wondrous habitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain an
erect posture in his boat, even when pitched about by the most
riotously perverse and cross-running seas.  Still more strange to see
him giddily perched upon the loggerhead itself, under such
circumstances.  But the sight of little Flask mounted upon gigantic
Daggoo was yet more curious; for sustaining himself with a cool,
indifferent, easy, unthought of, barbaric majesty, the noble negro to
every roll of the sea harmoniously rolled his fine form.  On his
broad back, flaxen-haired Flask seemed a snow-flake.  The bearer
looked nobler than the rider.  Though truly vivacious, tumultuous,
ostentatious little Flask would now and then stamp with impatience;
but not one added heave did he thereby give to the negro's lordly
chest.  So have I seen Passion and Vanity stamping the living
magnanimous earth, but the earth did not alter her tides and her
seasons for that.

Meanwhile Stubb, the third mate, betrayed no such far-gazing
solicitudes.  The whales might have made one of their regular
soundings, not a temporary dive from mere fright; and if that were
the case, Stubb, as his wont in such cases, it seems, was resolved to
solace the languishing interval with his pipe.  He withdrew it from
his hatband, where he always wore it aslant like a feather.  He
loaded it, and rammed home the loading with his thumb-end; but hardly
had he ignited his match across the rough sandpaper of his hand,
when Tashtego, his harpooneer, whose eyes had been setting to
windward like two fixed stars, suddenly dropped like light from his
erect attitude to his seat, crying out in a quick phrensy of hurry,
Down, down all, and give way!--there they are!

To a landsman, no whale, nor any sign of a herring, would have been
visible at that moment; nothing but a troubled bit of greenish white
water, and thin scattered puffs of vapour hovering over it, and
suffusingly blowing off to leeward, like the confused scud from white
rolling billows.  The air around suddenly vibrated and tingled, as it
were, like the air over intensely heated plates of iron.  Beneath
this atmospheric waving and curling, and partially beneath a thin
layer of water, also, the whales were swimming.  Seen in advance of
all the other indications, the puffs of vapour they spouted, seemed
their forerunning couriers and detached flying outriders.

All four boats were now in keen pursuit of that one spot of troubled
water and air.  But it bade fair to outstrip them; it flew on and on,
as a mass of interblending bubbles borne down a rapid stream from the
hills.

Pull, pull, my good boys, said Starbuck, in the lowest possible but
intensest concentrated whisper to his men; while the sharp fixed
glance from his eyes darted straight ahead of the bow, almost seemed
as two visible needles in two unerring binnacle compasses.  He did
not say much to his crew, though, nor did his crew say anything to
him.  Only the silence of the boat was at intervals startlingly
pierced by one of his peculiar whispers, now harsh with command, now
soft with entreaty.

How different the loud little King-Post.  Sing out and say"
4215	something, my hearties.  Roar and pull, my thunderbolts!  Beach me,
4216	beach me on their black backs, boys; only do that for me, and I'll
4217	sign over to you my Martha's Vineyard plantation, boys; including
4218	wife and children, boys.  Lay me on--lay me on!  O Lord, Lord! but I
4219	"shall go stark, staring mad!  See! see that white water!  And so
shouting, he pulled his hat from his head, and stamped up and down on
it; then picking it up, flirted it far off upon the sea; and finally
fell to rearing and plunging in the boat's stern like a crazed colt
from the prairie.

Look at that chap now, philosophically drawled Stubb, who, with his
unlighted short pipe, mechanically retained between his teeth, at a
short distance, followed after--He's got fits, that Flask has."
4220	Fits? yes, give him fits--that's the very word--pitch fits into 'em.
4221	Merrily, merrily, hearts-alive.  Pudding for supper, you
4222	know;--merry's the word.  Pull, babes--pull, sucklings--pull, all.
4223	But what the devil are you hurrying about?  Softly, softly, and
4224	steadily, my men.  Only pull, and keep pulling; nothing more.  Crack
4225	all your backbones, and bite your knives in two--that's all.  Take it
4226	easy--why don't ye take it easy, I say, and burst all your livers and
4227	"lungs!

But what it was that inscrutable Ahab said to that tiger-yellow crew
of his--these were words best omitted here; for you live under the
blessed light of the evangelical land.  Only the infidel sharks in
the audacious seas may give ear to such words, when, with tornado
brow, and eyes of red murder, and foam-glued lips, Ahab leaped after
his prey.

Meanwhile, all the boats tore on.  The repeated specific allusions of
Flask to that whale, as he called the fictitious monster which he
declared to be incessantly tantalizing his boat's bow with its
tail--these allusions of his were at times so vivid and life-like,
that they would cause some one or two of his men to snatch a fearful
look over the shoulder.  But this was against all rule; for the
oarsmen must put out their eyes, and ram a skewer through their
necks; usage pronouncing that they must have no organs but ears, and
no limbs but arms, in these critical moments.

It was a sight full of quick wonder and awe!  The vast swells of the
omnipotent sea; the surging, hollow roar they made, as they rolled
along the eight gunwales, like gigantic bowls in a boundless
bowling-green; the brief suspended agony of the boat, as it would tip
for an instant on the knife-like edge of the sharper waves, that
almost seemed threatening to cut it in two; the sudden profound dip
into the watery glens and hollows; the keen spurrings and goadings to
gain the top of the opposite hill; the headlong, sled-like slide down
its other side;--all these, with the cries of the headsmen and
harpooneers, and the shuddering gasps of the oarsmen, with the
wondrous sight of the ivory Pequod bearing down upon her boats with
outstretched sails, like a wild hen after her screaming brood;--all
this was thrilling.

Not the raw recruit, marching from the bosom of his wife into the
fever heat of his first battle; not the dead man's ghost encountering
the first unknown phantom in the other world;--neither of these can
feel stranger and stronger emotions than that man does, who for the
first time finds himself pulling into the charmed, churned circle of
the hunted sperm whale.

The dancing white water made by the chase was now becoming more and
more visible, owing to the increasing darkness of the dun
cloud-shadows flung upon the sea.  The jets of vapour no longer
blended, but tilted everywhere to right and left; the whales seemed
separating their wakes.  The boats were pulled more apart; Starbuck
giving chase to three whales running dead to leeward.  Our sail was
now set, and, with the still rising wind, we rushed along; the boat
going with such madness through the water, that the lee oars could
scarcely be worked rapidly enough to escape being torn from the
row-locks.

Soon we were running through a suffusing wide veil of mist; neither
ship nor boat to be seen.

Give way, men, whispered Starbuck, drawing still further aft the
sheet of his sail; there is time to kill a fish yet before the"
4228	"squall comes.  There's white water again!--close to!  Spring!

Soon after, two cries in quick succession on each side of us denoted
that the other boats had got fast; but hardly were they overheard,
when with a lightning-like hurtling whisper Starbuck said: Stand"
4229	"up! and Queequeg, harpoon in hand, sprang to his feet.

Though not one of the oarsmen was then facing the life and death
peril so close to them ahead, yet with their eyes on the intense
countenance of the mate in the stern of the boat, they knew that the
imminent instant had come; they heard, too, an enormous wallowing
sound as of fifty elephants stirring in their litter.  Meanwhile the
boat was still booming through the mist, the waves curling and
hissing around us like the erected crests of enraged serpents.

That's his hump.  THERE, THERE, give it to him! whispered Starbuck.

A short rushing sound leaped out of the boat; it was the darted iron
of Queequeg.  Then all in one welded commotion came an invisible push
from astern, while forward the boat seemed striking on a ledge; the
sail collapsed and exploded; a gush of scalding vapour shot up near
by; something rolled and tumbled like an earthquake beneath us.  The
whole crew were half suffocated as they were tossed helter-skelter
into the white curdling cream of the squall.  Squall, whale, and
harpoon had all blended together; and the whale, merely grazed by the
iron, escaped.

Though completely swamped, the boat was nearly unharmed.  Swimming
round it we picked up the floating oars, and lashing them across the
gunwale, tumbled back to our places.  There we sat up to our knees in
the sea, the water covering every rib and plank, so that to our
downward gazing eyes the suspended craft seemed a coral boat grown up
to us from the bottom of the ocean.

The wind increased to a howl; the waves dashed their bucklers
together; the whole squall roared, forked, and crackled around us
like a white fire upon the prairie, in which, unconsumed, we were
burning; immortal in these jaws of death!  In vain we hailed the
other boats; as well roar to the live coals down the chimney of a
flaming furnace as hail those boats in that storm.  Meanwhile the
driving scud, rack, and mist, grew darker with the shadows of night;
no sign of the ship could be seen.  The rising sea forbade all
attempts to bale out the boat.  The oars were useless as propellers,
performing now the office of life-preservers.  So, cutting the
lashing of the waterproof match keg, after many failures Starbuck
contrived to ignite the lamp in the lantern; then stretching it on a
waif pole, handed it to Queequeg as the standard-bearer of this
forlorn hope.  There, then, he sat, holding up that imbecile candle
in the heart of that almighty forlornness.  There, then, he sat, the
sign and symbol of a man without faith, hopelessly holding up hope in
the midst of despair.

Wet, drenched through, and shivering cold, despairing of ship or
boat, we lifted up our eyes as the dawn came on.  The mist still
spread over the sea, the empty lantern lay crushed in the bottom of
the boat.  Suddenly Queequeg started to his feet, hollowing his hand
to his ear.  We all heard a faint creaking, as of ropes and yards
hitherto muffled by the storm.  The sound came nearer and nearer; the
thick mists were dimly parted by a huge, vague form.  Affrighted, we
all sprang into the sea as the ship at last loomed into view, bearing
right down upon us within a distance of not much more than its
length.

Floating on the waves we saw the abandoned boat, as for one instant
it tossed and gaped beneath the ship's bows like a chip at the base
of a cataract; and then the vast hull rolled over it, and it was seen
no more till it came up weltering astern.  Again we swam for it, were
dashed against it by the seas, and were at last taken up and safely
landed on board.  Ere the squall came close to, the other boats had
cut loose from their fish and returned to the ship in good time.  The
ship had given us up, but was still cruising, if haply it might light
upon some token of our perishing,--an oar or a lance pole.



CHAPTER 49

The Hyena.


There are certain queer times and occasions in this strange mixed
affair we call life when a man takes this whole universe for a vast
practical joke, though the wit thereof he but dimly discerns, and
more than suspects that the joke is at nobody's expense but his own.
However, nothing dispirits, and nothing seems worth while disputing.
He bolts down all events, all creeds, and beliefs, and persuasions,
all hard things visible and invisible, never mind how knobby; as an
ostrich of potent digestion gobbles down bullets and gun flints.  And
as for small difficulties and worryings, prospects of sudden
disaster, peril of life and limb; all these, and death itself, seem
to him only sly, good-natured hits, and jolly punches in the side
bestowed by the unseen and unaccountable old joker.  That odd sort of
wayward mood I am speaking of, comes over a man only in some time of
extreme tribulation; it comes in the very midst of his earnestness,
so that what just before might have seemed to him a thing most
momentous, now seems but a part of the general joke.  There is
nothing like the perils of whaling to breed this free and easy sort
of genial, desperado philosophy; and with it I now regarded this
whole voyage of the Pequod, and the great White Whale its object.

Queequeg, said I, when they had dragged me, the last man, to the
deck, and I was still shaking myself in my jacket to fling off the
water; Queequeg, my fine friend, does this sort of thing often"
4230	"happen?  Without much emotion, though soaked through just like me,
he gave me to understand that such things did often happen.

Mr. Stubb, said I, turning to that worthy, who, buttoned up in his
oil-jacket, was now calmly smoking his pipe in the rain; Mr. Stubb,"
4231	I think I have heard you say that of all whalemen you ever met, our
4232	chief mate, Mr. Starbuck, is by far the most careful and prudent.  I
4233	suppose then, that going plump on a flying whale with your sail set
4234	"in a foggy squall is the height of a whaleman's discretion?

Certain.  I've lowered for whales from a leaking ship in a gale off"
4235	"Cape Horn.

Mr. Flask, said I, turning to little King-Post, who was standing
close by; you are experienced in these things, and I am not.  Will"
4236	you tell me whether it is an unalterable law in this fishery, Mr.
4237	Flask, for an oarsman to break his own back pulling himself
4238	"back-foremost into death's jaws?

Can't you twist that smaller? said Flask.  Yes, that's the law.  I"
4239	should like to see a boat's crew backing water up to a whale face
4240	foremost.  Ha, ha! the whale would give them squint for squint, mind
4241	"that!

Here then, from three impartial witnesses, I had a deliberate
statement of the entire case.  Considering, therefore, that squalls
and capsizings in the water and consequent bivouacks on the deep,
were matters of common occurrence in this kind of life; considering
that at the superlatively critical instant of going on to the whale I
must resign my life into the hands of him who steered the
boat--oftentimes a fellow who at that very moment is in his
impetuousness upon the point of scuttling the craft with his own
frantic stampings; considering that the particular disaster to our
own particular boat was chiefly to be imputed to Starbuck's driving
on to his whale almost in the teeth of a squall, and considering that
Starbuck, notwithstanding, was famous for his great heedfulness in
the fishery; considering that I belonged to this uncommonly prudent
Starbuck's boat; and finally considering in what a devil's chase I
was implicated, touching the White Whale: taking all things together,
I say, I thought I might as well go below and make a rough draft of
my will.  Queequeg, said I, come along, you shall be my lawyer,"
4242	"executor, and legatee.

It may seem strange that of all men sailors should be tinkering at
their last wills and testaments, but there are no people in the world
more fond of that diversion.  This was the fourth time in my nautical
life that I had done the same thing.  After the ceremony was
concluded upon the present occasion, I felt all the easier; a stone
was rolled away from my heart.  Besides, all the days I should now
live would be as good as the days that Lazarus lived after his
resurrection; a supplementary clean gain of so many months or weeks
as the case might be.  I survived myself; my death and burial were
locked up in my chest.  I looked round me tranquilly and contentedly,
like a quiet ghost with a clean conscience sitting inside the bars of
a snug family vault.

Now then, thought I, unconsciously rolling up the sleeves of my
frock, here goes for a cool, collected dive at death and destruction,
and the devil fetch the hindmost.



CHAPTER 50

Ahab's Boat and Crew.  Fedallah.


Who would have thought it, Flask! cried Stubb; if I had but one"
4243	leg you would not catch me in a boat, unless maybe to stop the
4244	"plug-hole with my timber toe.  Oh! he's a wonderful old man!

I don't think it so strange, after all, on that account, said
Flask.  If his leg were off at the hip, now, it would be a different"
4245	thing.  That would disable him; but he has one knee, and good part of
4246	"the other left, you know.

I don't know that, my little man; I never yet saw him kneel.


Among whale-wise people it has often been argued whether, considering
the paramount importance of his life to the success of the voyage, it
is right for a whaling captain to jeopardize that life in the active
perils of the chase.  So Tamerlane's soldiers often argued with tears
in their eyes, whether that invaluable life of his ought to be
carried into the thickest of the fight.

But with Ahab the question assumed a modified aspect.  Considering
that with two legs man is but a hobbling wight in all times of
danger; considering that the pursuit of whales is always under great
and extraordinary difficulties; that every individual moment, indeed,
then comprises a peril; under these circumstances is it wise for any
maimed man to enter a whale-boat in the hunt?  As a general thing,
the joint-owners of the Pequod must have plainly thought not.

Ahab well knew that although his friends at home would think little
of his entering a boat in certain comparatively harmless vicissitudes
of the chase, for the sake of being near the scene of action and
giving his orders in person, yet for Captain Ahab to have a boat
actually apportioned to him as a regular headsman in the hunt--above
all for Captain Ahab to be supplied with five extra men, as that same
boat's crew, he well knew that such generous conceits never entered the
heads of the owners of the Pequod.  Therefore he had not solicited a
boat's crew from them, nor had he in any way hinted his desires on
that head.  Nevertheless he had taken private measures of his own
touching all that matter.  Until Cabaco's published discovery, the
sailors had little foreseen it, though to be sure when, after being a
little while out of port, all hands had concluded the customary
business of fitting the whaleboats for service; when some time after
this Ahab was now and then found bestirring himself in the matter of
making thole-pins with his own hands for what was thought to be one
of the spare boats, and even solicitously cutting the small wooden
skewers, which when the line is running out are pinned over the
groove in the bow: when all this was observed in him, and
particularly his solicitude in having an extra coat of sheathing in
the bottom of the boat, as if to make it better withstand the pointed
pressure of his ivory limb; and also the anxiety he evinced in
exactly shaping the thigh board, or clumsy cleat, as it is sometimes
called, the horizontal piece in the boat's bow for bracing the knee
against in darting or stabbing at the whale; when it was observed how
often he stood up in that boat with his solitary knee fixed in the
semi-circular depression in the cleat, and with the carpenter's
chisel gouged out a little here and straightened it a little there;
all these things, I say, had awakened much interest and curiosity at
the time.  But almost everybody supposed that this particular
preparative heedfulness in Ahab must only be with a view to the
ultimate chase of Moby Dick; for he had already revealed his
intention to hunt that mortal monster in person.  But such a
supposition did by no means involve the remotest suspicion as to any
boat's crew being assigned to that boat.

Now, with the subordinate phantoms, what wonder remained soon waned
away; for in a whaler wonders soon wane.  Besides, now and then such
unaccountable odds and ends of strange nations come up from the
unknown nooks and ash-holes of the earth to man these floating
outlaws of whalers; and the ships themselves often pick up such queer
castaway creatures found tossing about the open sea on planks, bits
of wreck, oars, whaleboats, canoes, blown-off Japanese junks, and
what not; that Beelzebub himself might climb up the side and step
down into the cabin to chat with the captain, and it would not create
any unsubduable excitement in the forecastle.

But be all this as it may, certain it is that while the subordinate
phantoms soon found their place among the crew, though still as it
were somehow distinct from them, yet that hair-turbaned Fedallah
remained a muffled mystery to the last.  Whence he came in a mannerly
world like this, by what sort of unaccountable tie he soon evinced
himself to be linked with Ahab's peculiar fortunes; nay, so far as to
have some sort of a half-hinted influence; Heaven knows, but it might
have been even authority over him; all this none knew.  But one
cannot sustain an indifferent air concerning Fedallah.  He was such a
creature as civilized, domestic people in the temperate zone only see
in their dreams, and that but dimly; but the like of whom now and
then glide among the unchanging Asiatic communities, especially the
Oriental isles to the east of the continent--those insulated,
immemorial, unalterable countries, which even in these modern days
still preserve much of the ghostly aboriginalness of earth's primal
generations, when the memory of the first man was a distinct
recollection, and all men his descendants, unknowing whence he came,
eyed each other as real phantoms, and asked of the sun and the moon
why they were created and to what end; when though, according to
Genesis, the angels indeed consorted with the daughters of men, the
devils also, add the uncanonical Rabbins, indulged in mundane amours.



CHAPTER 51

The Spirit-Spout.


Days, weeks passed, and under easy sail, the ivory Pequod had slowly
swept across four several cruising-grounds; that off the Azores; off
the Cape de Verdes; on the Plate (so called), being off the mouth of
the Rio de la Plata; and the Carrol Ground, an unstaked, watery
locality, southerly from St. Helena.

It was while gliding through these latter waters that one serene and
moonlight night, when all the waves rolled by like scrolls of silver;
and, by their soft, suffusing seethings, made what seemed a silvery
silence, not a solitude; on such a silent night a silvery jet was
seen far in advance of the white bubbles at the bow.  Lit up by the
moon, it looked celestial; seemed some plumed and glittering god
uprising from the sea.  Fedallah first descried this jet.  For of
these moonlight nights, it was his wont to mount to the main-mast
head, and stand a look-out there, with the same precision as if it
had been day.  And yet, though herds of whales were seen by night,
not one whaleman in a hundred would venture a lowering for them.  You
may think with what emotions, then, the seamen beheld this old
Oriental perched aloft at such unusual hours; his turban and the
moon, companions in one sky.  But when, after spending his uniform
interval there for several successive nights without uttering a
single sound; when, after all this silence, his unearthly voice was
heard announcing that silvery, moon-lit jet, every reclining mariner
started to his feet as if some winged spirit had lighted in the
rigging, and hailed the mortal crew.  There she blows!  Had the
trump of judgment blown, they could not have quivered more; yet still
they felt no terror; rather pleasure.  For though it was a most
unwonted hour, yet so impressive was the cry, and so deliriously
exciting, that almost every soul on board instinctively desired a
lowering.

Walking the deck with quick, side-lunging strides, Ahab commanded the
t'gallant sails and royals to be set, and every stunsail spread.  The
best man in the ship must take the helm.  Then, with every mast-head
manned, the piled-up craft rolled down before the wind.  The strange,
upheaving, lifting tendency of the taffrail breeze filling the
hollows of so many sails, made the buoyant, hovering deck to feel
like air beneath the feet; while still she rushed along, as if two
antagonistic influences were struggling in her--one to mount direct
to heaven, the other to drive yawingly to some horizontal goal.  And
had you watched Ahab's face that night, you would have thought that
in him also two different things were warring.  While his one live
leg made lively echoes along the deck, every stroke of his dead limb
sounded like a coffin-tap.  On life and death this old man walked.
But though the ship so swiftly sped, and though from every eye, like
arrows, the eager glances shot, yet the silvery jet was no more seen
that night.  Every sailor swore he saw it once, but not a second
time.

This midnight-spout had almost grown a forgotten thing, when, some
days after, lo! at the same silent hour, it was again announced:
again it was descried by all; but upon making sail to overtake it,
once more it disappeared as if it had never been.  And so it served
us night after night, till no one heeded it but to wonder at it.
Mysteriously jetted into the clear moonlight, or starlight, as the
case might be; disappearing again for one whole day, or two days, or
three; and somehow seeming at every distinct repetition to be
advancing still further and further in our van, this solitary jet
seemed for ever alluring us on.

Nor with the immemorial superstition of their race, and in accordance
with the preternaturalness, as it seemed, which in many things
invested the Pequod, were there wanting some of the seamen who swore
that whenever and wherever descried; at however remote times, or in
however far apart latitudes and longitudes, that unnearable spout was
cast by one self-same whale; and that whale, Moby Dick.  For a time,
there reigned, too, a sense of peculiar dread at this flitting
apparition, as if it were treacherously beckoning us on and on, in
order that the monster might turn round upon us, and rend us at last
in the remotest and most savage seas.

These temporary apprehensions, so vague but so awful, derived a
wondrous potency from the contrasting serenity of the weather, in
which, beneath all its blue blandness, some thought there lurked a
devilish charm, as for days and days we voyaged along, through seas
so wearily, lonesomely mild, that all space, in repugnance to our
vengeful errand, seemed vacating itself of life before our urn-like
prow.

But, at last, when turning to the eastward, the Cape winds began
howling around us, and we rose and fell upon the long, troubled seas
that are there; when the ivory-tusked Pequod sharply bowed to the
blast, and gored the dark waves in her madness, till, like showers of
silver chips, the foam-flakes flew over her bulwarks; then all this
desolate vacuity of life went away, but gave place to sights more
dismal than before.

Close to our bows, strange forms in the water darted hither and
thither before us; while thick in our rear flew the inscrutable
sea-ravens.  And every morning, perched on our stays, rows of these
birds were seen; and spite of our hootings, for a long time
obstinately clung to the hemp, as though they deemed our ship some
drifting, uninhabited craft; a thing appointed to desolation, and
therefore fit roosting-place for their homeless selves.  And heaved
and heaved, still unrestingly heaved the black sea, as if its vast
tides were a conscience; and the great mundane soul were in anguish
and remorse for the long sin and suffering it had bred.

Cape of Good Hope, do they call ye?  Rather Cape Tormentoto, as
called of yore; for long allured by the perfidious silences that
before had attended us, we found ourselves launched into this
tormented sea, where guilty beings transformed into those fowls and
these fish, seemed condemned to swim on everlastingly without any
haven in store, or beat that black air without any horizon.  But
calm, snow-white, and unvarying; still directing its fountain of
feathers to the sky; still beckoning us on from before, the solitary
jet would at times be descried.

During all this blackness of the elements, Ahab, though assuming for
the time the almost continual command of the drenched and dangerous
deck, manifested the gloomiest reserve; and more seldom than ever
addressed his mates.  In tempestuous times like these, after
everything above and aloft has been secured, nothing more can be done
but passively to await the issue of the gale.  Then Captain and crew
become practical fatalists.  So, with his ivory leg inserted into its
accustomed hole, and with one hand firmly grasping a shroud, Ahab for
hours and hours would stand gazing dead to windward, while an
occasional squall of sleet or snow would all but congeal his very
eyelashes together.  Meantime, the crew driven from the forward part
of the ship by the perilous seas that burstingly broke over its bows,
stood in a line along the bulwarks in the waist; and the better to
guard against the leaping waves, each man had slipped himself into a
sort of bowline secured to the rail, in which he swung as in a
loosened belt.  Few or no words were spoken; and the silent ship, as
if manned by painted sailors in wax, day after day tore on through
all the swift madness and gladness of the demoniac waves.  By night
the same muteness of humanity before the shrieks of the ocean
prevailed; still in silence the men swung in the bowlines; still
wordless Ahab stood up to the blast.  Even when wearied nature seemed
demanding repose he would not seek that repose in his hammock.
Never could Starbuck forget the old man's aspect, when one night
going down into the cabin to mark how the barometer stood, he saw him
with closed eyes sitting straight in his floor-screwed chair; the
rain and half-melted sleet of the storm from which he had some time
before emerged, still slowly dripping from the unremoved hat and
coat.  On the table beside him lay unrolled one of those charts of
tides and currents which have previously been spoken of.  His lantern
swung from his tightly clenched hand.  Though the body was erect, the
head was thrown back so that the closed eyes were pointed towards the
needle of the tell-tale that swung from a beam in the ceiling.*


*The cabin-compass is called the tell-tale, because without going to
the compass at the helm, the Captain, while below, can inform himself
of the course of the ship.


Terrible old man! thought Starbuck with a shudder, sleeping in this
gale, still thou steadfastly eyest thy purpose.



CHAPTER 52

The Albatross.


South-eastward from the Cape, off the distant Crozetts, a good
cruising ground for Right Whalemen, a sail loomed ahead, the Goney
(Albatross) by name.  As she slowly drew nigh, from my lofty perch at
the fore-mast-head, I had a good view of that sight so remarkable to
a tyro in the far ocean fisheries--a whaler at sea, and long absent
from home.

As if the waves had been fullers, this craft was bleached like the
skeleton of a stranded walrus.  All down her sides, this spectral
appearance was traced with long channels of reddened rust, while all
her spars and her rigging were like the thick branches of trees
furred over with hoar-frost.  Only her lower sails were set.  A wild
sight it was to see her long-bearded look-outs at those three
mast-heads.  They seemed clad in the skins of beasts, so torn and
bepatched the raiment that had survived nearly four years of
cruising.  Standing in iron hoops nailed to the mast, they swayed and
swung over a fathomless sea; and though, when the ship slowly glided
close under our stern, we six men in the air came so nigh to each
other that we might almost have leaped from the mast-heads of one
ship to those of the other; yet, those forlorn-looking fishermen,
mildly eyeing us as they passed, said not one word to our own
look-outs, while the quarter-deck hail was being heard from below.

Ship ahoy!  Have ye seen the White Whale?

But as the strange captain, leaning over the pallid bulwarks, was in
the act of putting his trumpet to his mouth, it somehow fell from his
hand into the sea; and the wind now rising amain, he in vain strove
to make himself heard without it.  Meantime his ship was still
increasing the distance between.  While in various silent ways
the seamen of the Pequod were evincing their observance of this
ominous incident at the first mere mention of the White Whale's name
to another ship, Ahab for a moment paused; it almost seemed as though
he would have lowered a boat to board the stranger, had not the
threatening wind forbade.  But taking advantage of his windward
position, he again seized his trumpet, and knowing by her aspect that
the stranger vessel was a Nantucketer and shortly bound home, he
loudly hailed--Ahoy there!  This is the Pequod, bound round the"
4247	world!  Tell them to address all future letters to the Pacific ocean!
4248	and this time three years, if I am not at home, tell them to address
4249	"them to--

At that moment the two wakes were fairly crossed, and instantly,
then, in accordance with their singular ways, shoals of small
harmless fish, that for some days before had been placidly swimming
by our side, darted away with what seemed shuddering fins, and ranged
themselves fore and aft with the stranger's flanks.  Though in the
course of his continual voyagings Ahab must often before have noticed
a similar sight, yet, to any monomaniac man, the veriest trifles
capriciously carry meanings.

Swim away from me, do ye? murmured Ahab, gazing over into the
water.  There seemed but little in the words, but the tone conveyed
more of deep helpless sadness than the insane old man had ever before
evinced.  But turning to the steersman, who thus far had been holding
the ship in the wind to diminish her headway, he cried out in his old
lion voice,--Up helm!  Keep her off round the world!

Round the world!  There is much in that sound to inspire proud
feelings; but whereto does all that circumnavigation conduct?  Only
through numberless perils to the very point whence we started, where
those that we left behind secure, were all the time before us.

Were this world an endless plain, and by sailing eastward we could
for ever reach new distances, and discover sights more sweet and
strange than any Cyclades or Islands of King Solomon, then there were
promise in the voyage.  But in pursuit of those far mysteries we
dream of, or in tormented chase of that demon phantom that, some time
or other, swims before all human hearts; while chasing such over this
round globe, they either lead us on in barren mazes or midway leave
us whelmed.



CHAPTER 53

The Gam.


The ostensible reason why Ahab did not go on board of the whaler we
had spoken was this: the wind and sea betokened storms.  But even had
this not been the case, he would not after all, perhaps, have boarded
her--judging by his subsequent conduct on similar occasions--if so it
had been that, by the process of hailing, he had obtained a negative
answer to the question he put.  For, as it eventually turned out, he
cared not to consort, even for five minutes, with any stranger
captain, except he could contribute some of that information he so
absorbingly sought.  But all this might remain inadequately
estimated, were not something said here of the peculiar usages of
whaling-vessels when meeting each other in foreign seas, and
especially on a common cruising-ground.

If two strangers crossing the Pine Barrens in New York State, or the
equally desolate Salisbury Plain in England; if casually encountering
each other in such inhospitable wilds, these twain, for the life of
them, cannot well avoid a mutual salutation; and stopping for a
moment to interchange the news; and, perhaps, sitting down for a
while and resting in concert: then, how much more natural that upon
the illimitable Pine Barrens and Salisbury Plains of the sea, two
whaling vessels descrying each other at the ends of the earth--off
lone Fanning's Island, or the far away King's Mills; how much more
natural, I say, that under such circumstances these ships should not
only interchange hails, but come into still closer, more friendly and
sociable contact.  And especially would this seem to be a matter of
course, in the case of vessels owned in one seaport, and whose
captains, officers, and not a few of the men are personally known to
each other; and consequently, have all sorts of dear domestic things
to talk about.

For the long absent ship, the outward-bounder, perhaps, has letters
on board; at any rate, she will be sure to let her have some papers
of a date a year or two later than the last one on her blurred and
thumb-worn files.  And in return for that courtesy, the outward-bound
ship would receive the latest whaling intelligence from the
cruising-ground to which she may be destined, a thing of the utmost
importance to her.  And in degree, all this will hold true concerning
whaling vessels crossing each other's track on the cruising-ground
itself, even though they are equally long absent from home.  For one
of them may have received a transfer of letters from some third, and
now far remote vessel; and some of those letters may be for the
people of the ship she now meets.  Besides, they would exchange the
whaling news, and have an agreeable chat.  For not only would they
meet with all the sympathies of sailors, but likewise with all the
peculiar congenialities arising from a common pursuit and mutually
shared privations and perils.

Nor would difference of country make any very essential difference;
that is, so long as both parties speak one language, as is the case
with Americans and English.  Though, to be sure, from the small
number of English whalers, such meetings do not very often occur, and
when they do occur there is too apt to be a sort of shyness between
them; for your Englishman is rather reserved, and your Yankee, he
does not fancy that sort of thing in anybody but himself.  Besides,
the English whalers sometimes affect a kind of metropolitan
superiority over the American whalers; regarding the long, lean
Nantucketer, with his nondescript provincialisms, as a sort of
sea-peasant.  But where this superiority in the English whalemen
does really consist, it would be hard to say, seeing that the Yankees
in one day, collectively, kill more whales than all the English,
collectively, in ten years.  But this is a harmless little foible in
the English whale-hunters, which the Nantucketer does not take much
to heart; probably, because he knows that he has a few foibles
himself.

So, then, we see that of all ships separately sailing the sea, the
whalers have most reason to be sociable--and they are so.  Whereas,
some merchant ships crossing each other's wake in the mid-Atlantic,
will oftentimes pass on without so much as a single word of
recognition, mutually cutting each other on the high seas, like a
brace of dandies in Broadway; and all the time indulging, perhaps, in
finical criticism upon each other's rig.  As for Men-of-War, when
they chance to meet at sea, they first go through such a string of
silly bowings and scrapings, such a ducking of ensigns, that there
does not seem to be much right-down hearty good-will and brotherly
love about it at all.  As touching Slave-ships meeting, why, they are
in such a prodigious hurry, they run away from each other as soon as
possible.  And as for Pirates, when they chance to cross each other's
cross-bones, the first hail is--How many skulls?--the same way that
whalers hail--How many barrels?  And that question once answered,
pirates straightway steer apart, for they are infernal villains on
both sides, and don't like to see overmuch of each other's villanous
likenesses.

But look at the godly, honest, unostentatious, hospitable, sociable,
free-and-easy whaler!  What does the whaler do when she meets another
whaler in any sort of decent weather?  She has a GAM, a thing so
utterly unknown to all other ships that they never heard of the name
even; and if by chance they should hear of it, they only grin at it,
and repeat gamesome stuff about spouters and blubber-boilers, and
such like pretty exclamations.  Why it is that all Merchant-seamen,
and also all Pirates and Man-of-War's men, and Slave-ship sailors,
cherish such a scornful feeling towards Whale-ships; this is a
question it would be hard to answer.  Because, in the case of
pirates, say, I should like to know whether that profession of theirs
has any peculiar glory about it.  It sometimes ends in uncommon
elevation, indeed; but only at the gallows.  And besides, when a man
is elevated in that odd fashion, he has no proper foundation for his
superior altitude.  Hence, I conclude, that in boasting himself to be
high lifted above a whaleman, in that assertion the pirate has no
solid basis to stand on.

But what is a GAM?  You might wear out your index-finger running up
and down the columns of dictionaries, and never find the word.  Dr.
Johnson never attained to that erudition; Noah Webster's ark does not
hold it.  Nevertheless, this same expressive word has now for many
years been in constant use among some fifteen thousand true born
Yankees.  Certainly, it needs a definition, and should be
incorporated into the Lexicon.  With that view, let me learnedly
define it.

GAM.  NOUN--A SOCIAL MEETING OF TWO (OR MORE) WHALESHIPS, GENERALLY
ON A CRUISING-GROUND; WHEN, AFTER EXCHANGING HAILS, THEY EXCHANGE
VISITS BY BOATS' CREWS; THE TWO CAPTAINS REMAINING, FOR THE TIME, ON
BOARD OF ONE SHIP, AND THE TWO CHIEF MATES ON THE OTHER.

There is another little item about Gamming which must not be
forgotten here.  All professions have their own little peculiarities
of detail; so has the whale fishery.  In a pirate, man-of-war, or
slave ship, when the captain is rowed anywhere in his boat, he always
sits in the stern sheets on a comfortable, sometimes cushioned seat
there, and often steers himself with a pretty little milliner's
tiller decorated with gay cords and ribbons.  But the whale-boat has
no seat astern, no sofa of that sort whatever, and no tiller at all.
High times indeed, if whaling captains were wheeled about the water
on castors like gouty old aldermen in patent chairs.  And as for a
tiller, the whale-boat never admits of any such effeminacy; and
therefore as in gamming a complete boat's crew must leave the ship,
and hence as the boat steerer or harpooneer is of the number, that
subordinate is the steersman upon the occasion, and the captain,
having no place to sit in, is pulled off to his visit all standing
like a pine tree.  And often you will notice that being conscious of
the eyes of the whole visible world resting on him from the sides of
the two ships, this standing captain is all alive to the importance
of sustaining his dignity by maintaining his legs.  Nor is this any
very easy matter; for in his rear is the immense projecting steering
oar hitting him now and then in the small of his back, the after-oar
reciprocating by rapping his knees in front.  He is thus completely
wedged before and behind, and can only expand himself sideways by
settling down on his stretched legs; but a sudden, violent pitch of
the boat will often go far to topple him, because length of
foundation is nothing without corresponding breadth.  Merely make a
spread angle of two poles, and you cannot stand them up.  Then,
again, it would never do in plain sight of the world's riveted eyes,
it would never do, I say, for this straddling captain to be seen
steadying himself the slightest particle by catching hold of anything
with his hands; indeed, as token of his entire, buoyant self-command,
he generally carries his hands in his trowsers' pockets; but perhaps
being generally very large, heavy hands, he carries them there for
ballast.  Nevertheless there have occurred instances, well
authenticated ones too, where the captain has been known for an
uncommonly critical moment or two, in a sudden squall say--to seize
hold of the nearest oarsman's hair, and hold on there like grim
death.



CHAPTER 54

The Town-Ho's Story.


(AS TOLD AT THE GOLDEN INN)


The Cape of Good Hope, and all the watery region round about there,
is much like some noted four corners of a great highway, where you
meet more travellers than in any other part.

It was not very long after speaking the Goney that another
homeward-bound whaleman, the Town-Ho,* was encountered.  She was
manned almost wholly by Polynesians.  In the short gam that ensued
she gave us strong news of Moby Dick.  To some the general interest
in the White Whale was now wildly heightened by a circumstance of the
Town-Ho's story, which seemed obscurely to involve with the whale a
certain wondrous, inverted visitation of one of those so called
judgments of God which at times are said to overtake some men.  This
latter circumstance, with its own particular accompaniments, forming
what may be called the secret part of the tragedy about to be
narrated, never reached the ears of Captain Ahab or his mates.  For
that secret part of the story was unknown to the captain of the
Town-Ho himself.  It was the private property of three confederate
white seamen of that ship, one of whom, it seems, communicated it to
Tashtego with Romish injunctions of secrecy, but the following night
Tashtego rambled in his sleep, and revealed so much of it in that
way, that when he was wakened he could not well withhold the rest.
Nevertheless, so potent an influence did this thing have on those
seamen in the Pequod who came to the full knowledge of it, and by
such a strange delicacy, to call it so, were they governed in this
matter, that they kept the secret among themselves so that it never
transpired abaft the Pequod's main-mast.  Interweaving in its proper
place this darker thread with the story as publicly narrated on the
ship, the whole of this strange affair I now proceed to put on
lasting record.


*The ancient whale-cry upon first sighting a whale from the
mast-head, still used by whalemen in hunting the famous Gallipagos
terrapin.


For my humor's sake, I shall preserve the style in which I once
narrated it at Lima, to a lounging circle of my Spanish friends, one
saint's eve, smoking upon the thick-gilt tiled piazza of the Golden
Inn.  Of those fine cavaliers, the young Dons, Pedro and Sebastian,
were on the closer terms with me; and hence the interluding questions
they occasionally put, and which are duly answered at the time.

Some two years prior to my first learning the events which I am"
4250	about rehearsing to you, gentlemen, the Town-Ho, Sperm Whaler of
4251	Nantucket, was cruising in your Pacific here, not very many days'
4252	sail eastward from the eaves of this good Golden Inn.  She was
4253	somewhere to the northward of the Line.  One morning upon handling
4254	the pumps, according to daily usage, it was observed that she made
4255	more water in her hold than common.  They supposed a sword-fish had
4256	stabbed her, gentlemen.  But the captain, having some unusual reason
4257	for believing that rare good luck awaited him in those latitudes; and
4258	therefore being very averse to quit them, and the leak not being then
4259	considered at all dangerous, though, indeed, they could not find it
4260	after searching the hold as low down as was possible in rather heavy
4261	weather, the ship still continued her cruisings, the mariners working
4262	at the pumps at wide and easy intervals; but no good luck came; more
4263	days went by, and not only was the leak yet undiscovered, but it
4264	sensibly increased.  So much so, that now taking some alarm, the
4265	captain, making all sail, stood away for the nearest harbor among the
4266	islands, there to have his hull hove out and repaired.
4267	
4268	"Though no small passage was before her, yet, if the commonest chance
favoured, he did not at all fear that his ship would founder by the
way, because his pumps were of the best, and being periodically
relieved at them, those six-and-thirty men of his could easily keep
the ship free; never mind if the leak should double on her.  In
truth, well nigh the whole of this passage being attended by very
prosperous breezes, the Town-Ho had all but certainly arrived in
perfect safety at her port without the occurrence of the least
fatality, had it not been for the brutal overbearing of Radney, the
mate, a Vineyarder, and the bitterly provoked vengeance of Steelkilt,
a Lakeman and desperado from Buffalo.

'Lakeman!--Buffalo!  Pray, what is a Lakeman, and where is Buffalo?'"
4269	said Don Sebastian, rising in his swinging mat of grass.
4270	
4271	"On the eastern shore of our Lake Erie, Don; but--I crave your
courtesy--may be, you shall soon hear further of all that.  Now,
gentlemen, in square-sail brigs and three-masted ships, well-nigh as
large and stout as any that ever sailed out of your old Callao to far
Manilla; this Lakeman, in the land-locked heart of our America, had
yet been nurtured by all those agrarian freebooting impressions
popularly connected with the open ocean.  For in their interflowing
aggregate, those grand fresh-water seas of ours,--Erie, and Ontario,
and Huron, and Superior, and Michigan,--possess an ocean-like
expansiveness, with many of the ocean's noblest traits; with many of
its rimmed varieties of races and of climes.  They contain round
archipelagoes of romantic isles, even as the Polynesian waters do; in
large part, are shored by two great contrasting nations, as the
Atlantic is; they furnish long maritime approaches to our numerous
territorial colonies from the East, dotted all round their banks;
here and there are frowned upon by batteries, and by the goat-like
craggy guns of lofty Mackinaw; they have heard the fleet thunderings
of naval victories; at intervals, they yield their beaches to wild
barbarians, whose red painted faces flash from out their peltry
wigwams; for leagues and leagues are flanked by ancient and unentered
forests, where the gaunt pines stand like serried lines of kings in
Gothic genealogies; those same woods harboring wild Afric beasts of
prey, and silken creatures whose exported furs give robes to Tartar
Emperors; they mirror the paved capitals of Buffalo and Cleveland, as
well as Winnebago villages; they float alike the full-rigged merchant
ship, the armed cruiser of the State, the steamer, and the beech
canoe; they are swept by Borean and dismasting blasts as direful as
any that lash the salted wave; they know what shipwrecks are, for out
of sight of land, however inland, they have drowned full many a
midnight ship with all its shrieking crew.  Thus, gentlemen, though
an inlander, Steelkilt was wild-ocean born, and wild-ocean nurtured;
as much of an audacious mariner as any.  And for Radney, though in
his infancy he may have laid him down on the lone Nantucket beach, to
nurse at his maternal sea; though in after life he had long followed
our austere Atlantic and your contemplative Pacific; yet was he quite
as vengeful and full of social quarrel as the backwoods seaman, fresh
from the latitudes of buck-horn handled bowie-knives.  Yet was this
Nantucketer a man with some good-hearted traits; and this Lakeman, a
mariner, who though a sort of devil indeed, might yet by inflexible
firmness, only tempered by that common decency of human recognition
which is the meanest slave's right; thus treated, this Steelkilt had
long been retained harmless and docile.  At all events, he had proved
so thus far; but Radney was doomed and made mad, and Steelkilt--but,
gentlemen, you shall hear.

It was not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing her"
4272	prow for her island haven, that the Town-Ho's leak seemed again
4273	increasing, but only so as to require an hour or more at the pumps
4274	every day.  You must know that in a settled and civilized ocean like
4275	our Atlantic, for example, some skippers think little of pumping
4276	their whole way across it; though of a still, sleepy night, should
4277	the officer of the deck happen to forget his duty in that respect,
4278	the probability would be that he and his shipmates would never again
4279	remember it, on account of all hands gently subsiding to the bottom.
4280	Nor in the solitary and savage seas far from you to the westward,
4281	gentlemen, is it altogether unusual for ships to keep clanging at
4282	their pump-handles in full chorus even for a voyage of considerable
4283	length; that is, if it lie along a tolerably accessible coast, or if
4284	any other reasonable retreat is afforded them.  It is only when a
4285	leaky vessel is in some very out of the way part of those waters,
4286	some really landless latitude, that her captain begins to feel a
4287	little anxious.
4288	
4289	"Much this way had it been with the Town-Ho; so when her leak was
found gaining once more, there was in truth some small concern
manifested by several of her company; especially by Radney the mate.
He commanded the upper sails to be well hoisted, sheeted home anew,
and every way expanded to the breeze.  Now this Radney, I suppose,
was as little of a coward, and as little inclined to any sort of
nervous apprehensiveness touching his own person as any fearless,
unthinking creature on land or on sea that you can conveniently
imagine, gentlemen.  Therefore when he betrayed this solicitude about
the safety of the ship, some of the seamen declared that it was only
on account of his being a part owner in her.  So when they were
working that evening at the pumps, there was on this head no small
gamesomeness slily going on among them, as they stood with their feet
continually overflowed by the rippling clear water; clear as any
mountain spring, gentlemen--that bubbling from the pumps ran across
the deck, and poured itself out in steady spouts at the lee
scupper-holes.

Now, as you well know, it is not seldom the case in this"
4290	conventional world of ours--watery or otherwise; that when a person
4291	placed in command over his fellow-men finds one of them to be very
4292	significantly his superior in general pride of manhood, straightway
4293	against that man he conceives an unconquerable dislike and
4294	bitterness; and if he have a chance he will pull down and pulverize
4295	that subaltern's tower, and make a little heap of dust of it.  Be
4296	this conceit of mine as it may, gentlemen, at all events Steelkilt
4297	was a tall and noble animal with a head like a Roman, and a flowing
4298	golden beard like the tasseled housings of your last viceroy's
4299	snorting charger; and a brain, and a heart, and a soul in him,
4300	gentlemen, which had made Steelkilt Charlemagne, had he been born son
4301	to Charlemagne's father.  But Radney, the mate, was ugly as a mule;
4302	yet as hardy, as stubborn, as malicious.  He did not love Steelkilt,
4303	and Steelkilt knew it.
4304	
4305	"Espying the mate drawing near as he was toiling at the pump with the
rest, the Lakeman affected not to notice him, but unawed, went on
with his gay banterings.

'Aye, aye, my merry lads, it's a lively leak this; hold a cannikin,"
4306	one of ye, and let's have a taste.  By the Lord, it's worth bottling!
4307	I tell ye what, men, old Rad's investment must go for it! he had
4308	best cut away his part of the hull and tow it home.  The fact is,
4309	boys, that sword-fish only began the job; he's come back again with a
4310	gang of ship-carpenters, saw-fish, and file-fish, and what not; and
4311	the whole posse of 'em are now hard at work cutting and slashing at
4312	the bottom; making improvements, I suppose.  If old Rad were here
4313	now, I'd tell him to jump overboard and scatter 'em.  They're playing
4314	the devil with his estate, I can tell him.  But he's a simple old
4315	soul,--Rad, and a beauty too.  Boys, they say the rest of his
4316	property is invested in looking-glasses.  I wonder if he'd give a
4317	poor devil like me the model of his nose.'
4318	
4319	"'Damn your eyes! what's that pump stopping for?' roared Radney,
pretending not to have heard the sailors' talk.  'Thunder away at
it!'

'Aye, aye, sir,' said Steelkilt, merry as a cricket.  'Lively, boys,
lively, now!'  And with that the pump clanged like fifty
fire-engines; the men tossed their hats off to it, and ere long that
peculiar gasping of the lungs was heard which denotes the fullest
tension of life's utmost energies.

Quitting the pump at last, with the rest of his band, the Lakeman"
4320	went forward all panting, and sat himself down on the windlass; his
4321	face fiery red, his eyes bloodshot, and wiping the profuse sweat from
4322	his brow.  Now what cozening fiend it was, gentlemen, that possessed
4323	Radney to meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperated
4324	state, I know not; but so it happened.  Intolerably striding along
4325	the deck, the mate commanded him to get a broom and sweep down the
4326	planks, and also a shovel, and remove some offensive matters
4327	consequent upon allowing a pig to run at large.
4328	
4329	"Now, gentlemen, sweeping a ship's deck at sea is a piece of
household work which in all times but raging gales is regularly
attended to every evening; it has been known to be done in the case
of ships actually foundering at the time.  Such, gentlemen, is the
inflexibility of sea-usages and the instinctive love of neatness in
seamen; some of whom would not willingly drown without first washing
their faces.  But in all vessels this broom business is the
prescriptive province of the boys, if boys there be aboard.  Besides,
it was the stronger men in the Town-Ho that had been divided into
gangs, taking turns at the pumps; and being the most athletic seaman
of them all, Steelkilt had been regularly assigned captain of one of
the gangs; consequently he should have been freed from any trivial
business not connected with truly nautical duties, such being the
case with his comrades.  I mention all these particulars so that you
may understand exactly how this affair stood between the two men.

But there was more than this: the order about the shovel was almost"
4330	as plainly meant to sting and insult Steelkilt, as though Radney had
4331	spat in his face.  Any man who has gone sailor in a whale-ship will
4332	understand this; and all this and doubtless much more, the Lakeman
4333	fully comprehended when the mate uttered his command.  But as he sat
4334	still for a moment, and as he steadfastly looked into the mate's
4335	malignant eye and perceived the stacks of powder-casks heaped up in
4336	him and the slow-match silently burning along towards them; as he
4337	instinctively saw all this, that strange forbearance and
4338	unwillingness to stir up the deeper passionateness in any already
4339	ireful being--a repugnance most felt, when felt at all, by really
4340	valiant men even when aggrieved--this nameless phantom feeling,
4341	gentlemen, stole over Steelkilt.
4342	
4343	"Therefore, in his ordinary tone, only a little broken by the bodily
exhaustion he was temporarily in, he answered him saying that
sweeping the deck was not his business, and he would not do it.  And
then, without at all alluding to the shovel, he pointed to three
lads as the customary sweepers; who, not being billeted at the
pumps, had done little or nothing all day.  To this, Radney replied
with an oath, in a most domineering and outrageous manner
unconditionally reiterating his command; meanwhile advancing upon the
still seated Lakeman, with an uplifted cooper's club hammer which he
had snatched from a cask near by.

Heated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the pumps,"
4344	for all his first nameless feeling of forbearance the sweating
4345	Steelkilt could but ill brook this bearing in the mate; but somehow
4346	still smothering the conflagration within him, without speaking he
4347	remained doggedly rooted to his seat, till at last the incensed
4348	Radney shook the hammer within a few inches of his face, furiously
4349	commanding him to do his bidding.
4350	
4351	"Steelkilt rose, and slowly retreating round the windlass, steadily
followed by the mate with his menacing hammer, deliberately repeated
his intention not to obey.  Seeing, however, that his forbearance had
not the slightest effect, by an awful and unspeakable intimation with
his twisted hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man; but it
was to no purpose.  And in this way the two went once slowly round
the windlass; when, resolved at last no longer to retreat, bethinking
him that he had now forborne as much as comported with his humor, the
Lakeman paused on the hatches and thus spoke to the officer:

'Mr. Radney, I will not obey you.  Take that hammer away, or look to"
4352	yourself.'  But the predestinated mate coming still closer to him,
4353	where the Lakeman stood fixed, now shook the heavy hammer within an
4354	inch of his teeth; meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable
4355	maledictions.  Retreating not the thousandth part of an inch;
4356	stabbing him in the eye with the unflinching poniard of his glance,
4357	Steelkilt, clenching his right hand behind him and creepingly drawing
4358	it back, told his persecutor that if the hammer but grazed his cheek
4359	he (Steelkilt) would murder him.  But, gentlemen, the fool had been
4360	branded for the slaughter by the gods.  Immediately the hammer
4361	touched the cheek; the next instant the lower jaw of the mate was
4362	stove in his head; he fell on the hatch spouting blood like a whale.
4363	
4364	"Ere the cry could go aft Steelkilt was shaking one of the backstays
leading far aloft to where two of his comrades were standing their
mastheads.  They were both Canallers.

'Canallers!' cried Don Pedro.  'We have seen many whale-ships in our"
4365	harbours, but never heard of your Canallers.  Pardon: who and what are
4366	they?'
4367	
4368	"'Canallers, Don, are the boatmen belonging to our grand Erie Canal.
You must have heard of it.'

'Nay, Senor; hereabouts in this dull, warm, most lazy, and"
4369	hereditary land, we know but little of your vigorous North.'
4370	
4371	"'Aye?  Well then, Don, refill my cup.  Your chicha's very fine; and
ere proceeding further I will tell ye what our Canallers are; for
such information may throw side-light upon my story.'

For three hundred and sixty miles, gentlemen, through the entire"
4372	breadth of the state of New York; through numerous populous cities
4373	and most thriving villages; through long, dismal, uninhabited swamps,
4374	and affluent, cultivated fields, unrivalled for fertility; by
4375	billiard-room and bar-room; through the holy-of-holies of great
4376	forests; on Roman arches over Indian rivers; through sun and shade;
4377	by happy hearts or broken; through all the wide contrasting scenery
4378	of those noble Mohawk counties; and especially, by rows of snow-white
4379	chapels, whose spires stand almost like milestones, flows one
4380	continual stream of Venetianly corrupt and often lawless life.
4381	There's your true Ashantee, gentlemen; there howl your pagans; where
4382	you ever find them, next door to you; under the long-flung shadow,
4383	and the snug patronising lee of churches.  For by some curious
4384	fatality, as it is often noted of your metropolitan freebooters that
4385	they ever encamp around the halls of justice, so sinners, gentlemen,
4386	most abound in holiest vicinities.
4387	
4388	"'Is that a friar passing?' said Don Pedro, looking downwards into
the crowded plazza, with humorous concern.

'Well for our northern friend, Dame Isabella's Inquisition wanes in"
4389	Lima,' laughed Don Sebastian.  'Proceed, Senor.'
4390	
4391	"'A moment!  Pardon!' cried another of the company.  'In the name of
all us Limeese, I but desire to express to you, sir sailor, that we
have by no means overlooked your delicacy in not substituting present
Lima for distant Venice in your corrupt comparison.  Oh! do not bow
and look surprised; you know the proverb all along this
coast--Corrupt as Lima.  It but bears out your saying, too;
churches more plentiful than billiard-tables, and for ever open--and
Corrupt as Lima.  So, too, Venice; I have been there; the holy city
of the blessed evangelist, St. Mark!--St. Dominic, purge it!  Your
cup!  Thanks: here I refill; now, you pour out again.'

Freely depicted in his own vocation, gentlemen, the Canaller would"
4392	make a fine dramatic hero, so abundantly and picturesquely wicked is
4393	he.  Like Mark Antony, for days and days along his green-turfed,
4394	flowery Nile, he indolently floats, openly toying with his
4395	red-cheeked Cleopatra, ripening his apricot thigh upon the sunny
4396	deck.  But ashore, all this effeminacy is dashed.  The brigandish
4397	guise which the Canaller so proudly sports; his slouched and
4398	gaily-ribboned hat betoken his grand features.  A terror to the
4399	smiling innocence of the villages through which he floats; his swart
4400	visage and bold swagger are not unshunned in cities.  Once a vagabond
4401	on his own canal, I have received good turns from one of these
4402	Canallers; I thank him heartily; would fain be not ungrateful; but it
4403	is often one of the prime redeeming qualities of your man of
4404	violence, that at times he has as stiff an arm to back a poor
4405	stranger in a strait, as to plunder a wealthy one.  In sum,
4406	gentlemen, what the wildness of this canal life is, is emphatically
4407	evinced by this; that our wild whale-fishery contains so many of its
4408	most finished graduates, and that scarce any race of mankind, except
4409	Sydney men, are so much distrusted by our whaling captains.  Nor does
4410	it at all diminish the curiousness of this matter, that to many
4411	thousands of our rural boys and young men born along its line, the
4412	probationary life of the Grand Canal furnishes the sole transition
4413	between quietly reaping in a Christian corn-field, and recklessly
4414	ploughing the waters of the most barbaric seas.
4415	
4416	"'I see!  I see!' impetuously exclaimed Don Pedro, spilling his
chicha upon his silvery ruffles.  'No need to travel!  The world's
one Lima.  I had thought, now, that at your temperate North the
generations were cold and holy as the hills.--But the story.'

I left off, gentlemen, where the Lakeman shook the backstay."
4417	Hardly had he done so, when he was surrounded by the three junior
4418	mates and the four harpooneers, who all crowded him to the deck.  But
4419	sliding down the ropes like baleful comets, the two Canallers rushed
4420	into the uproar, and sought to drag their man out of it towards the
4421	forecastle.  Others of the sailors joined with them in this attempt,
4422	and a twisted turmoil ensued; while standing out of harm's way, the
4423	valiant captain danced up and down with a whale-pike, calling upon
4424	his officers to manhandle that atrocious scoundrel, and smoke him
4425	along to the quarter-deck.  At intervals, he ran close up to the
4426	revolving border of the confusion, and prying into the heart of it
4427	with his pike, sought to prick out the object of his resentment.  But
4428	Steelkilt and his desperadoes were too much for them all; they
4429	succeeded in gaining the forecastle deck, where, hastily slewing
4430	about three or four large casks in a line with the windlass, these
4431	sea-Parisians entrenched themselves behind the barricade.
4432	
4433	"'Come out of that, ye pirates!' roared the captain, now menacing
them with a pistol in each hand, just brought to him by the steward.
'Come out of that, ye cut-throats!'

Steelkilt leaped on the barricade, and striding up and down there,"
4434	defied the worst the pistols could do; but gave the captain to
4435	understand distinctly, that his (Steelkilt's) death would be the
4436	signal for a murderous mutiny on the part of all hands.  Fearing in
4437	his heart lest this might prove but too true, the captain a little
4438	desisted, but still commanded the insurgents instantly to return to
4439	their duty.
4440	
4441	"'Will you promise not to touch us, if we do?' demanded their
ringleader.

'Turn to! turn to!--I make no promise;--to your duty!  Do you want"
4442	to sink the ship, by knocking off at a time like this?  Turn to!' and
4443	he once more raised a pistol.
4444	
4445	"'Sink the ship?' cried Steelkilt.  'Aye, let her sink.  Not a man of
us turns to, unless you swear not to raise a rope-yarn against us.
What say ye, men?' turning to his comrades.  A fierce cheer was their
response.

The Lakeman now patrolled the barricade, all the while keeping his"
4446	eye on the Captain, and jerking out such sentences as these:--'It's
4447	not our fault; we didn't want it; I told him to take his hammer away;
4448	it was boy's business; he might have known me before this; I told him
4449	not to prick the buffalo; I believe I have broken a finger here
4450	against his cursed jaw; ain't those mincing knives down in the
4451	forecastle there, men? look to those handspikes, my hearties.
4452	Captain, by God, look to yourself; say the word; don't be a fool;
4453	forget it all; we are ready to turn to; treat us decently, and we're
4454	your men; but we won't be flogged.'
4455	
4456	"'Turn to!  I make no promises, turn to, I say!'

'Look ye, now,' cried the Lakeman, flinging out his arm towards him,"
4457	'there are a few of us here (and I am one of them) who have shipped
4458	for the cruise, d'ye see; now as you well know, sir, we can claim our
4459	discharge as soon as the anchor is down; so we don't want a row; it's
4460	not our interest; we want to be peaceable; we are ready to work, but
4461	we won't be flogged.'
4462	
4463	"'Turn to!' roared the Captain.

Steelkilt glanced round him a moment, and then said:--'I tell you"
4464	what it is now, Captain, rather than kill ye, and be hung for such a
4465	shabby rascal, we won't lift a hand against ye unless ye attack us;
4466	but till you say the word about not flogging us, we don't do a hand's
4467	turn.'
4468	
4469	"'Down into the forecastle then, down with ye, I'll keep ye there
till ye're sick of it.  Down ye go.'

'Shall we?' cried the ringleader to his men.  Most of them were"
4470	against it; but at length, in obedience to Steelkilt, they preceded
4471	him down into their dark den, growlingly disappearing, like bears
4472	into a cave.
4473	
4474	"As the Lakeman's bare head was just level with the planks, the
Captain and his posse leaped the barricade, and rapidly drawing over
the slide of the scuttle, planted their group of hands upon it, and
loudly called for the steward to bring the heavy brass padlock
belonging to the companionway.

Then opening the slide a little, the Captain whispered something down
the crack, closed it, and turned the key upon them--ten in
number--leaving on deck some twenty or more, who thus far had
remained neutral.

All night a wide-awake watch was kept by all the officers, forward"
4475	and aft, especially about the forecastle scuttle and fore hatchway;
4476	at which last place it was feared the insurgents might emerge, after
4477	breaking through the bulkhead below.  But the hours of darkness
4478	passed in peace; the men who still remained at their duty toiling
4479	hard at the pumps, whose clinking and clanking at intervals through
4480	the dreary night dismally resounded through the ship.
4481	
4482	"At sunrise the Captain went forward, and knocking on the deck,
summoned the prisoners to work; but with a yell they refused.  Water
was then lowered down to them, and a couple of handfuls of biscuit
were tossed after it; when again turning the key upon them and
pocketing it, the Captain returned to the quarter-deck.  Twice every
day for three days this was repeated; but on the fourth morning a
confused wrangling, and then a scuffling was heard, as the customary
summons was delivered; and suddenly four men burst up from the
forecastle, saying they were ready to turn to.  The fetid closeness
of the air, and a famishing diet, united perhaps to some fears of
ultimate retribution, had constrained them to surrender at
discretion.  Emboldened by this, the Captain reiterated his demand to
the rest, but Steelkilt shouted up to him a terrific hint to stop his
babbling and betake himself where he belonged.  On the fifth morning
three others of the mutineers bolted up into the air from the
desperate arms below that sought to restrain them.  Only three were
left.

'Better turn to, now?' said the Captain with a heartless jeer."
4483	
4484	"'Shut us up again, will ye!' cried Steelkilt.

'Oh certainly,' the Captain, and the key clicked."
4485	
4486	"It was at this point, gentlemen, that enraged by the defection of
seven of his former associates, and stung by the mocking voice that
had last hailed him, and maddened by his long entombment in a place
as black as the bowels of despair; it was then that Steelkilt
proposed to the two Canallers, thus far apparently of one mind with
him, to burst out of their hole at the next summoning of the
garrison; and armed with their keen mincing knives (long, crescentic,
heavy implements with a handle at each end) run amuck from the
bowsprit to the taffrail; and if by any devilishness of desperation
possible, seize the ship.  For himself, he would do this, he said,
whether they joined him or not.  That was the last night he should
spend in that den.  But the scheme met with no opposition on the part
of the other two; they swore they were ready for that, or for any
other mad thing, for anything in short but a surrender.  And what was
more, they each insisted upon being the first man on deck, when the
time to make the rush should come.  But to this their leader as
fiercely objected, reserving that priority for himself; particularly
as his two comrades would not yield, the one to the other, in the
matter; and both of them could not be first, for the ladder would but
admit one man at a time.  And here, gentlemen, the foul play of these
miscreants must come out.

Upon hearing the frantic project of their leader, each in his own"
4487	separate soul had suddenly lighted, it would seem, upon the same
4488	piece of treachery, namely: to be foremost in breaking out, in
4489	order to be the first of the three, though the last of the ten, to
4490	surrender; and thereby secure whatever small chance of pardon such
4491	conduct might merit.  But when Steelkilt made known his determination
4492	still to lead them to the last, they in some way, by some subtle
4493	chemistry of villany, mixed their before secret treacheries together;
4494	and when their leader fell into a doze, verbally opened their souls
4495	to each other in three sentences; and bound the sleeper with cords,
4496	and gagged him with cords; and shrieked out for the Captain at
4497	midnight.
4498	
4499	"Thinking murder at hand, and smelling in the dark for the blood, he
and all his armed mates and harpooneers rushed for the forecastle.
In a few minutes the scuttle was opened, and, bound hand and foot,
the still struggling ringleader was shoved up into the air by his
perfidious allies, who at once claimed the honour of securing a man
who had been fully ripe for murder.  But all these were collared, and
dragged along the deck like dead cattle; and, side by side, were
seized up into the mizzen rigging, like three quarters of meat, and
there they hung till morning.  'Damn ye,' cried the Captain, pacing
to and fro before them, 'the vultures would not touch ye, ye
villains!'

At sunrise he summoned all hands; and separating those who had"
4500	rebelled from those who had taken no part in the mutiny, he told the
4501	former that he had a good mind to flog them all round--thought, upon
4502	the whole, he would do so--he ought to--justice demanded it; but for
4503	the present, considering their timely surrender, he would let them go
4504	with a reprimand, which he accordingly administered in the vernacular.
4505	
4506	"'But as for you, ye carrion rogues,' turning to the three men in the
rigging--'for you, I mean to mince ye up for the try-pots;' and,
seizing a rope, he applied it with all his might to the backs of the
two traitors, till they yelled no more, but lifelessly hung their
heads sideways, as the two crucified thieves are drawn.

'My wrist is sprained with ye!' he cried, at last; 'but there is"
4507	still rope enough left for you, my fine bantam, that wouldn't give
4508	up.  Take that gag from his mouth, and let us hear what he can say
4509	for himself.'
4510	
4511	"For a moment the exhausted mutineer made a tremulous motion of his
cramped jaws, and then painfully twisting round his head, said in a
sort of hiss, 'What I say is this--and mind it well--if you flog me,
I murder you!'

'Say ye so? then see how ye frighten me'--and the Captain drew off"
4512	with the rope to strike.
4513	
4514	"'Best not,' hissed the Lakeman.

'But I must,'--and the rope was once more drawn back for the stroke."
4515	
4516	"Steelkilt here hissed out something, inaudible to all but the
Captain; who, to the amazement of all hands, started back, paced the
deck rapidly two or three times, and then suddenly throwing down his
rope, said, 'I won't do it--let him go--cut him down: d'ye hear?'

But as the junior mates were hurrying to execute the order, a pale
man, with a bandaged head, arrested them--Radney the chief mate.
Ever since the blow, he had lain in his berth; but that morning,
hearing the tumult on the deck, he had crept out, and thus far had
watched the whole scene.  Such was the state of his mouth, that he
could hardly speak; but mumbling something about his being willing
and able to do what the captain dared not attempt, he snatched the
rope and advanced to his pinioned foe.

'You are a coward!' hissed the Lakeman."
4517	
4518	"'So I am, but take that.'  The mate was in the very act of striking,
when another hiss stayed his uplifted arm.  He paused: and then
pausing no more, made good his word, spite of Steelkilt's threat,
whatever that might have been.  The three men were then cut down, all
hands were turned to, and, sullenly worked by the moody seamen, the
iron pumps clanged as before.

Just after dark that day, when one watch had retired below, a clamor"
4519	was heard in the forecastle; and the two trembling traitors running
4520	up, besieged the cabin door, saying they durst not consort with the
4521	crew.  Entreaties, cuffs, and kicks could not drive them back, so at
4522	their own instance they were put down in the ship's run for
4523	salvation.  Still, no sign of mutiny reappeared among the rest.  On
4524	the contrary, it seemed, that mainly at Steelkilt's instigation, they
4525	had resolved to maintain the strictest peacefulness, obey all orders
4526	to the last, and, when the ship reached port, desert her in a body.
4527	But in order to insure the speediest end to the voyage, they all
4528	agreed to another thing--namely, not to sing out for whales, in case
4529	any should be discovered.  For, spite of her leak, and spite of all her
4530	other perils, the Town-Ho still maintained her mast-heads, and her
4531	captain was just as willing to lower for a fish that moment, as on
4532	the day his craft first struck the cruising ground; and Radney the mate
4533	was quite as ready to change his berth for a boat, and with his
4534	bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the vital jaw of the whale.
4535	
4536	"But though the Lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this sort of
passiveness in their conduct, he kept his own counsel (at least till
all was over) concerning his own proper and private revenge upon the
man who had stung him in the ventricles of his heart.  He was in
Radney the chief mate's watch; and as if the infatuated man sought to
run more than half way to meet his doom, after the scene at the
rigging, he insisted, against the express counsel of the captain,
upon resuming the head of his watch at night.  Upon this, and one or
two other circumstances, Steelkilt systematically built the plan of
his revenge.

During the night, Radney had an unseamanlike way of sitting on the"
4537	bulwarks of the quarter-deck, and leaning his arm upon the gunwale of
4538	the boat which was hoisted up there, a little above the ship's side.
4539	In this attitude, it was well known, he sometimes dozed.  There was a
4540	considerable vacancy between the boat and the ship, and down between
4541	this was the sea.  Steelkilt calculated his time, and found that his
4542	next trick at the helm would come round at two o'clock, in the
4543	morning of the third day from that in which he had been betrayed.  At
4544	his leisure, he employed the interval in braiding something very
4545	carefully in his watches below.
4546	
4547	"'What are you making there?' said a shipmate.

'What do you think? what does it look like?'"
4548	
4549	"'Like a lanyard for your bag; but it's an odd one, seems to me.'

'Yes, rather oddish,' said the Lakeman, holding it at arm's length
before him; 'but I think it will answer.  Shipmate, I haven't enough
twine,--have you any?'

But there was none in the forecastle."
4550	
4551	"'Then I must get some from old Rad;' and he rose to go aft.

'You don't mean to go a begging to HIM!' said a sailor."
4552	
4553	"'Why not?  Do you think he won't do me a turn, when it's to help
himself in the end, shipmate?' and going to the mate, he looked at
him quietly, and asked him for some twine to mend his hammock.  It
was given him--neither twine nor lanyard were seen again; but the
next night an iron ball, closely netted, partly rolled from the
pocket of the Lakeman's monkey jacket, as he was tucking the coat
into his hammock for a pillow.  Twenty-four hours after, his trick at
the silent helm--nigh to the man who was apt to doze over the grave
always ready dug to the seaman's hand--that fatal hour was then to
come; and in the fore-ordaining soul of Steelkilt, the mate was
already stark and stretched as a corpse, with his forehead crushed
in.

But, gentlemen, a fool saved the would-be murderer from the bloody"
4554	deed he had planned.  Yet complete revenge he had, and without being
4555	the avenger.  For by a mysterious fatality, Heaven itself seemed to
4556	step in to take out of his hands into its own the damning thing he
4557	would have done.
4558	
4559	"It was just between daybreak and sunrise of the morning of the
second day, when they were washing down the decks, that a stupid
Teneriffe man, drawing water in the main-chains, all at once shouted
out, 'There she rolls! there she rolls!'  Jesu, what a whale!  It was
Moby Dick.

'Moby Dick!' cried Don Sebastian; 'St. Dominic!  Sir sailor, but do"
4560	whales have christenings?  Whom call you Moby Dick?'
4561	
4562	"'A very white, and famous, and most deadly immortal monster,
Don;--but that would be too long a story.'

'How? how?' cried all the young Spaniards, crowding."
4563	
4564	"'Nay, Dons, Dons--nay, nay!  I cannot rehearse that now.  Let me get
more into the air, Sirs.'

'The chicha! the chicha!' cried Don Pedro; 'our vigorous friend looks"
4565	faint;--fill up his empty glass!'
4566	
4567	"No need, gentlemen; one moment, and I proceed.--Now, gentlemen, so
suddenly perceiving the snowy whale within fifty yards of the
ship--forgetful of the compact among the crew--in the excitement of
the moment, the Teneriffe man had instinctively and involuntarily
lifted his voice for the monster, though for some little time past it
had been plainly beheld from the three sullen mast-heads.  All was
now a phrensy.  'The White Whale--the White Whale!' was the cry from
captain, mates, and harpooneers, who, undeterred by fearful rumours,
were all anxious to capture so famous and precious a fish; while the
dogged crew eyed askance, and with curses, the appalling beauty of
the vast milky mass, that lit up by a horizontal spangling sun,
shifted and glistened like a living opal in the blue morning sea.
Gentlemen, a strange fatality pervades the whole career of these
events, as if verily mapped out before the world itself was charted.
The mutineer was the bowsman of the mate, and when fast to a fish, it
was his duty to sit next him, while Radney stood up with his lance in
the prow, and haul in or slacken the line, at the word of command.
Moreover, when the four boats were lowered, the mate's got the start;
and none howled more fiercely with delight than did Steelkilt, as he
strained at his oar.  After a stiff pull, their harpooneer got fast,
and, spear in hand, Radney sprang to the bow.  He was always a
furious man, it seems, in a boat.  And now his bandaged cry was, to
beach him on the whale's topmost back.  Nothing loath, his bowsman
hauled him up and up, through a blinding foam that blent two
whitenesses together; till of a sudden the boat struck as against a
sunken ledge, and keeling over, spilled out the standing mate.  That
instant, as he fell on the whale's slippery back, the boat righted,
and was dashed aside by the swell, while Radney was tossed over into
the sea, on the other flank of the whale.  He struck out through the
spray, and, for an instant, was dimly seen through that veil, wildly
seeking to remove himself from the eye of Moby Dick.  But the whale
rushed round in a sudden maelstrom; seized the swimmer between his
jaws; and rearing high up with him, plunged headlong again, and went
down.

Meantime, at the first tap of the boat's bottom, the Lakeman had"
4568	slackened the line, so as to drop astern from the whirlpool; calmly
4569	looking on, he thought his own thoughts.  But a sudden, terrific,
4570	downward jerking of the boat, quickly brought his knife to the line.
4571	He cut it; and the whale was free.  But, at some distance, Moby Dick
4572	rose again, with some tatters of Radney's red woollen shirt, caught
4573	in the teeth that had destroyed him.  All four boats gave chase
4574	again; but the whale eluded them, and finally wholly disappeared.
4575	
4576	"In good time, the Town-Ho reached her port--a savage, solitary
place--where no civilized creature resided.  There, headed by the
Lakeman, all but five or six of the foremastmen deliberately
deserted among the palms; eventually, as it turned out, seizing a
large double war-canoe of the savages, and setting sail for some
other harbor.

The ship's company being reduced to but a handful, the captain"
4577	called upon the Islanders to assist him in the laborious business of
4578	heaving down the ship to stop the leak.  But to such unresting
4579	vigilance over their dangerous allies was this small band of whites
4580	necessitated, both by night and by day, and so extreme was the hard
4581	work they underwent, that upon the vessel being ready again for sea,
4582	they were in such a weakened condition that the captain durst not put
4583	off with them in so heavy a vessel.  After taking counsel with his
4584	officers, he anchored the ship as far off shore as possible; loaded
4585	and ran out his two cannon from the bows; stacked his muskets on the
4586	poop; and warning the Islanders not to approach the ship at their
4587	peril, took one man with him, and setting the sail of his best
4588	whale-boat, steered straight before the wind for Tahiti, five hundred
4589	miles distant, to procure a reinforcement to his crew.
4590	
4591	"On the fourth day of the sail, a large canoe was descried, which
seemed to have touched at a low isle of corals.  He steered away from
it; but the savage craft bore down on him; and soon the voice of
Steelkilt hailed him to heave to, or he would run him under water.
The captain presented a pistol.  With one foot on each prow of the
yoked war-canoes, the Lakeman laughed him to scorn; assuring him that
if the pistol so much as clicked in the lock, he would bury him in
bubbles and foam.

'What do you want of me?' cried the captain."
4592	
4593	"'Where are you bound? and for what are you bound?' demanded
Steelkilt; 'no lies.'

'I am bound to Tahiti for more men.'"
4594	
4595	"'Very good.  Let me board you a moment--I come in peace.'  With that
he leaped from the canoe, swam to the boat; and climbing the gunwale,
stood face to face with the captain.

'Cross your arms, sir; throw back your head.  Now, repeat after me."
4596	As soon as Steelkilt leaves me, I swear to beach this boat on yonder
4597	island, and remain there six days.  If I do not, may lightning strike
4598	me!'
4599	
4600	"'A pretty scholar,' laughed the Lakeman.  'Adios, Senor!' and
leaping into the sea, he swam back to his comrades.

Watching the boat till it was fairly beached, and drawn up to the"
4601	roots of the cocoa-nut trees, Steelkilt made sail again, and in due
4602	time arrived at Tahiti, his own place of destination.  There, luck
4603	befriended him; two ships were about to sail for France, and were
4604	providentially in want of precisely that number of men which the
4605	sailor headed.  They embarked; and so for ever got the start of
4606	their former captain, had he been at all minded to work them legal
4607	retribution.
4608	
4609	"Some ten days after the French ships sailed, the whale-boat arrived,
and the captain was forced to enlist some of the more civilized
Tahitians, who had been somewhat used to the sea.  Chartering a small
native schooner, he returned with them to his vessel; and finding all
right there, again resumed his cruisings.

Where Steelkilt now is, gentlemen, none know; but upon the island of"
4610	Nantucket, the widow of Radney still turns to the sea which refuses
4611	to give up its dead; still in dreams sees the awful white whale that
4612	destroyed him.
4613	
4614	"'Are you through?' said Don Sebastian, quietly.

'I am, Don.'"
4615	
4616	"'Then I entreat you, tell me if to the best of your own convictions,
this your story is in substance really true?  It is so passing
wonderful!  Did you get it from an unquestionable source?  Bear with
me if I seem to press.'

'Also bear with all of us, sir sailor; for we all join in Don"
4617	Sebastian's suit,' cried the company, with exceeding interest.
4618	
4619	"'Is there a copy of the Holy Evangelists in the Golden Inn,
gentlemen?'

'Nay,' said Don Sebastian; 'but I know a worthy priest near by, who"
4620	will quickly procure one for me.  I go for it; but are you well
4621	advised? this may grow too serious.'
4622	
4623	"'Will you be so good as to bring the priest also, Don?'

'Though there are no Auto-da-Fe's in Lima now,' said one of the"
4624	company to another; 'I fear our sailor friend runs risk of the
4625	archiepiscopacy.  Let us withdraw more out of the moonlight.  I see
4626	no need of this.'
4627	
4628	"'Excuse me for running after you, Don Sebastian; but may I also beg
that you will be particular in procuring the largest sized
Evangelists you can.'


'This is the priest, he brings you the Evangelists,' said Don
Sebastian, gravely, returning with a tall and solemn figure.

'Let me remove my hat.  Now, venerable priest, further into the"
4629	light, and hold the Holy Book before me that I may touch it.
4630	
4631	"'So help me Heaven, and on my honour the story I have told ye,
gentlemen, is in substance and its great items, true.  I know it to
be true; it happened on this ball; I trod the ship; I knew the crew;
I have seen and talked with Steelkilt since the death of Radney.'"

4634	
4635	CHAPTER 55
4636	
4637	Of the Monstrous Pictures of Whales.
4638	
4639	
4640	I shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without canvas,
4641	something like the true form of the whale as he actually appears to
4642	the eye of the whaleman when in his own absolute body the whale is
4643	moored alongside the whale-ship so that he can be fairly stepped upon
4644	there.  It may be worth while, therefore, previously to advert to
4645	those curious imaginary portraits of him which even down to the
4646	present day confidently challenge the faith of the landsman.  It is
4647	time to set the world right in this matter, by proving such pictures
4648	of the whale all wrong.
4649	
4650	It may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions
4651	will be found among the oldest Hindoo, Egyptian, and Grecian
4652	sculptures.  For ever since those inventive but unscrupulous times
4653	when on the marble panellings of temples, the pedestals of statues,
4654	and on shields, medallions, cups, and coins, the dolphin was drawn in
4655	scales of chain-armor like Saladin's, and a helmeted head like St.
4656	George's; ever since then has something of the same sort of license
4657	prevailed, not only in most popular pictures of the whale, but in
4658	many scientific presentations of him.
4659	
4660	Now, by all odds, the most ancient extant portrait anyways purporting
4661	to be the whale's, is to be found in the famous cavern-pagoda of
4662	Elephanta, in India.  The Brahmins maintain that in the almost
4663	endless sculptures of that immemorial pagoda, all the trades and
4664	pursuits, every conceivable avocation of man, were prefigured ages
4665	before any of them actually came into being.  No wonder then, that in
4666	some sort our noble profession of whaling should have been there
4667	shadowed forth.  The Hindoo whale referred to, occurs in a separate
4668	department of the wall, depicting the incarnation of Vishnu in the
4669	form of leviathan, learnedly known as the Matse Avatar.  But though
4670	this sculpture is half man and half whale, so as only to give the
4671	tail of the latter, yet that small section of him is all wrong.  It
4672	looks more like the tapering tail of an anaconda, than the broad palms
4673	of the true whale's majestic flukes.
4674	
4675	But go to the old Galleries, and look now at a great Christian
4676	painter's portrait of this fish; for he succeeds no better than the
4677	antediluvian Hindoo.  It is Guido's picture of Perseus rescuing
4678	Andromeda from the sea-monster or whale.  Where did Guido get the
4679	model of such a strange creature as that?  Nor does Hogarth, in
4680	painting the same scene in his own Perseus Descending, make out one
4681	whit better.  The huge corpulence of that Hogarthian monster
4682	undulates on the surface, scarcely drawing one inch of water.  It has
4683	a sort of howdah on its back, and its distended tusked mouth into
4684	which the billows are rolling, might be taken for the Traitors' Gate
4685	leading from the Thames by water into the Tower.  Then, there are the
4686	Prodromus whales of old Scotch Sibbald, and Jonah's whale, as
4687	depicted in the prints of old Bibles and the cuts of old primers.
4688	What shall be said of these?  As for the book-binder's whale winding
4689	like a vine-stalk round the stock of a descending anchor--as stamped
4690	and gilded on the backs and title-pages of many books both old and
4691	new--that is a very picturesque but purely fabulous creature,
4692	imitated, I take it, from the like figures on antique vases.  Though
4693	universally denominated a dolphin, I nevertheless call this
4694	book-binder's fish an attempt at a whale; because it was so intended
4695	when the device was first introduced.  It was introduced by an old
4696	Italian publisher somewhere about the 15th century, during the
4697	Revival of Learning; and in those days, and even down to a
4698	comparatively late period, dolphins were popularly supposed to be a
4699	species of the Leviathan.
4700	
4701	In the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books you
4702	will at times meet with very curious touches at the whale, where all
4703	manner of spouts, jets d'eau, hot springs and cold, Saratoga and
4704	Baden-Baden, come bubbling up from his unexhausted brain.  In the
4705	title-page of the original edition of the Advancement of Learning
4706	you will find some curious whales.
4707	
4708	But quitting all these unprofessional attempts, let us glance at
4709	those pictures of leviathan purporting to be sober, scientific
4710	delineations, by those who know.  In old Harris's collection of
4711	voyages there are some plates of whales extracted from a Dutch book
4712	"of voyages, A.D. 1671, entitled A Whaling Voyage to Spitzbergen in
the ship Jonas in the Whale, Peter Peterson of Friesland, master."
4713	In one of those plates the whales, like great rafts of logs, are
4714	represented lying among ice-isles, with white bears running over
4715	their living backs.  In another plate, the prodigious blunder is made
4716	of representing the whale with perpendicular flukes.
4717	
4718	Then again, there is an imposing quarto, written by one Captain
4719	"Colnett, a Post Captain in the English navy, entitled A Voyage round
Cape Horn into the South Seas, for the purpose of extending the
Spermaceti Whale Fisheries.  In this book is an outline purporting"
4720	"to be a Picture of a Physeter or Spermaceti whale, drawn by scale
from one killed on the coast of Mexico, August, 1793, and hoisted on
deck.  I doubt not the captain had this veracious picture taken for"
4721	the benefit of his marines.  To mention but one thing about it, let
4722	me say that it has an eye which applied, according to the
4723	accompanying scale, to a full grown sperm whale, would make the eye
4724	of that whale a bow-window some five feet long.  Ah, my gallant
4725	captain, why did ye not give us Jonah looking out of that eye!
4726	
4727	Nor are the most conscientious compilations of Natural History for
4728	the benefit of the young and tender, free from the same heinousness
4729	of mistake.  Look at that popular work Goldsmith's Animated Nature.
4730	In the abridged London edition of 1807, there are plates of an
4731	alleged whale and a narwhale.  I do not wish to seem inelegant,
4732	but this unsightly whale looks much like an amputated sow; and, as
4733	for the narwhale, one glimpse at it is enough to amaze one, that in
4734	this nineteenth century such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine
4735	upon any intelligent public of schoolboys.
4736	
4737	Then, again, in 1825, Bernard Germain, Count de Lacepede, a great
4738	naturalist, published a scientific systemized whale book, wherein are
4739	several pictures of the different species of the Leviathan.  All
4740	these are not only incorrect, but the picture of the Mysticetus or
4741	Greenland whale (that is to say, the Right whale), even Scoresby, a
4742	long experienced man as touching that species, declares not to have
4743	its counterpart in nature.
4744	
4745	But the placing of the cap-sheaf to all this blundering business was
4746	reserved for the scientific Frederick Cuvier, brother to the famous
4747	Baron.  In 1836, he published a Natural History of Whales, in which
4748	he gives what he calls a picture of the Sperm Whale.  Before showing
4749	that picture to any Nantucketer, you had best provide for your
4750	summary retreat from Nantucket.  In a word, Frederick Cuvier's Sperm
4751	Whale is not a Sperm Whale, but a squash.  Of course, he never had
4752	the benefit of a whaling voyage (such men seldom have), but whence he
4753	derived that picture, who can tell?  Perhaps he got it as his
4754	scientific predecessor in the same field, Desmarest, got one of his
4755	authentic abortions; that is, from a Chinese drawing.  And what sort
4756	of lively lads with the pencil those Chinese are, many queer cups and
4757	saucers inform us.
4758	
4759	As for the sign-painters' whales seen in the streets hanging over the
4760	shops of oil-dealers, what shall be said of them?  They are generally
4761	Richard III. whales, with dromedary humps, and very savage;
4762	breakfasting on three or four sailor tarts, that is whaleboats full
4763	of mariners: their deformities floundering in seas of blood and blue
4764	paint.
4765	
4766	But these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so very
4767	surprising after all.  Consider!  Most of the scientific drawings
4768	have been taken from the stranded fish; and these are about as
4769	correct as a drawing of a wrecked ship, with broken back, would
4770	correctly represent the noble animal itself in all its undashed pride
4771	of hull and spars.  Though elephants have stood for their
4772	full-lengths, the living Leviathan has never yet fairly floated
4773	himself for his portrait.  The living whale, in his full majesty and
4774	significance, is only to be seen at sea in unfathomable waters; and
4775	afloat the vast bulk of him is out of sight, like a launched
4776	line-of-battle ship; and out of that element it is a thing eternally
4777	impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily into the air, so as to
4778	preserve all his mighty swells and undulations.  And, not to speak of
4779	the highly presumable difference of contour between a young sucking
4780	whale and a full-grown Platonian Leviathan; yet, even in the case of
4781	one of those young sucking whales hoisted to a ship's deck, such is
4782	then the outlandish, eel-like, limbered, varying shape of him, that
4783	his precise expression the devil himself could not catch.
4784	
4785	But it may be fancied, that from the naked skeleton of the stranded
4786	whale, accurate hints may be derived touching his true form.  Not at
4787	all.  For it is one of the more curious things about this Leviathan,
4788	that his skeleton gives very little idea of his general shape.
4789	Though Jeremy Bentham's skeleton, which hangs for candelabra in the
4790	library of one of his executors, correctly conveys the idea of a
4791	burly-browed utilitarian old gentleman, with all Jeremy's other
4792	leading personal characteristics; yet nothing of this kind could be
4793	inferred from any leviathan's articulated bones.  In fact, as the
4794	great Hunter says, the mere skeleton of the whale bears the same
4795	relation to the fully invested and padded animal as the insect does
4796	to the chrysalis that so roundingly envelopes it.  This peculiarity
4797	is strikingly evinced in the head, as in some part of this book will
4798	be incidentally shown.  It is also very curiously displayed in the
4799	side fin, the bones of which almost exactly answer to the bones of the
4800	human hand, minus only the thumb.  This fin has four regular
4801	bone-fingers, the index, middle, ring, and little finger.  But all
4802	these are permanently lodged in their fleshy covering, as the human
4803	"fingers in an artificial covering.  However recklessly the whale may
sometimes serve us, said humorous Stubb one day, he can never be
truly said to handle us without mittens."
4804	
4805	For all these reasons, then, any way you may look at it, you must
4806	needs conclude that the great Leviathan is that one creature in the
4807	world which must remain unpainted to the last.  True, one portrait
4808	may hit the mark much nearer than another, but none can hit it with
4809	any very considerable degree of exactness.  So there is no earthly
4810	way of finding out precisely what the whale really looks like.  And
4811	the only mode in which you can derive even a tolerable idea of his
4812	living contour, is by going a whaling yourself; but by so doing, you
4813	run no small risk of being eternally stove and sunk by him.
4814	Wherefore, it seems to me you had best not be too fastidious in your
4815	curiosity touching this Leviathan.

4818	
4819	CHAPTER 56
4820	
4821	Of the Less Erroneous Pictures of Whales, and the True Pictures of
4822	Whaling Scenes.
4823	
4824	
4825	In connexion with the monstrous pictures of whales, I am strongly
4826	tempted here to enter upon those still more monstrous stories of them
4827	which are to be found in certain books, both ancient and modern,
4828	especially in Pliny, Purchas, Hackluyt, Harris, Cuvier, etc.  But I
4829	pass that matter by.
4830	
4831	I know of only four published outlines of the great Sperm Whale;
4832	Colnett's, Huggins's, Frederick Cuvier's, and Beale's.  In the
4833	previous chapter Colnett and Cuvier have been referred to.  Huggins's
4834	is far better than theirs; but, by great odds, Beale's is the best.
4835	All Beale's drawings of this whale are good, excepting the middle
4836	figure in the picture of three whales in various attitudes, capping
4837	his second chapter.  His frontispiece, boats attacking Sperm Whales,
4838	though no doubt calculated to excite the civil scepticism of some
4839	parlor men, is admirably correct and life-like in its general effect.
4840	Some of the Sperm Whale drawings in J.  Ross Browne are pretty
4841	correct in contour; but they are wretchedly engraved.  That is not
4842	his fault though.
4843	
4844	Of the Right Whale, the best outline pictures are in Scoresby; but
4845	they are drawn on too small a scale to convey a desirable impression.
4846	He has but one picture of whaling scenes, and this is a sad
4847	deficiency, because it is by such pictures only, when at all well
4848	done, that you can derive anything like a truthful idea of the living
4849	whale as seen by his living hunters.
4850	
4851	But, taken for all in all, by far the finest, though in some details
4852	not the most correct, presentations of whales and whaling scenes to
4853	be anywhere found, are two large French engravings, well executed,
4854	and taken from paintings by one Garnery.  Respectively, they
4855	represent attacks on the Sperm and Right Whale.  In the first
4856	engraving a noble Sperm Whale is depicted in full majesty of might,
4857	just risen beneath the boat from the profundities of the ocean, and
4858	bearing high in the air upon his back the terrific wreck of the
4859	stoven planks.  The prow of the boat is partially unbroken, and is
4860	drawn just balancing upon the monster's spine; and standing in that
4861	prow, for that one single incomputable flash of time, you behold an
4862	oarsman, half shrouded by the incensed boiling spout of the whale,
4863	and in the act of leaping, as if from a precipice.  The action of the
4864	whole thing is wonderfully good and true.  The half-emptied line-tub
4865	floats on the whitened sea; the wooden poles of the spilled harpoons
4866	obliquely bob in it; the heads of the swimming crew are scattered
4867	about the whale in contrasting expressions of affright; while in the
4868	black stormy distance the ship is bearing down upon the scene.
4869	Serious fault might be found with the anatomical details of this
4870	whale, but let that pass; since, for the life of me, I could not draw
4871	so good a one.
4872	
4873	In the second engraving, the boat is in the act of drawing alongside
4874	the barnacled flank of a large running Right Whale, that rolls his
4875	black weedy bulk in the sea like some mossy rock-slide from the
4876	Patagonian cliffs.  His jets are erect, full, and black like soot; so
4877	that from so abounding a smoke in the chimney, you would think there
4878	must be a brave supper cooking in the great bowels below.  Sea fowls
4879	are pecking at the small crabs, shell-fish, and other sea candies and
4880	maccaroni, which the Right Whale sometimes carries on his pestilent
4881	back.  And all the while the thick-lipped leviathan is rushing
4882	through the deep, leaving tons of tumultuous white curds in his wake,
4883	and causing the slight boat to rock in the swells like a skiff caught
4884	nigh the paddle-wheels of an ocean steamer.  Thus, the foreground is
4885	all raging commotion; but behind, in admirable artistic contrast, is
4886	the glassy level of a sea becalmed, the drooping unstarched sails of
4887	the powerless ship, and the inert mass of a dead whale, a conquered
4888	fortress, with the flag of capture lazily hanging from the whale-pole
4889	inserted into his spout-hole.
4890	
4891	Who Garnery the painter is, or was, I know not.  But my life for it
4892	he was either practically conversant with his subject, or else
4893	marvellously tutored by some experienced whaleman.  The French are
4894	the lads for painting action.  Go and gaze upon all the paintings of
4895	Europe, and where will you find such a gallery of living and
4896	breathing commotion on canvas, as in that triumphal hall at
4897	Versailles; where the beholder fights his way, pell-mell, through the
4898	consecutive great battles of France; where every sword seems a flash
4899	of the Northern Lights, and the successive armed kings and Emperors
4900	dash by, like a charge of crowned centaurs?  Not wholly unworthy of a
4901	place in that gallery, are these sea battle-pieces of Garnery.
4902	
4903	The natural aptitude of the French for seizing the picturesqueness of
4904	things seems to be peculiarly evinced in what paintings and
4905	engravings they have of their whaling scenes.  With not one tenth of
4906	England's experience in the fishery, and not the thousandth part of
4907	that of the Americans, they have nevertheless furnished both nations
4908	with the only finished sketches at all capable of conveying the real
4909	spirit of the whale hunt.  For the most part, the English and
4910	American whale draughtsmen seem entirely content with presenting the
4911	mechanical outline of things, such as the vacant profile of the
4912	whale; which, so far as picturesqueness of effect is concerned, is
4913	about tantamount to sketching the profile of a pyramid.  Even
4914	Scoresby, the justly renowned Right whaleman, after giving us a stiff
4915	full length of the Greenland whale, and three or four delicate
4916	miniatures of narwhales and porpoises, treats us to a series of
4917	classical engravings of boat hooks, chopping knives, and grapnels;
4918	and with the microscopic diligence of a Leuwenhoeck submits to the
4919	inspection of a shivering world ninety-six fac-similes of magnified
4920	Arctic snow crystals.  I mean no disparagement to the excellent
4921	voyager (I honour him for a veteran), but in so important a matter it
4922	was certainly an oversight not to have procured for every crystal a
4923	sworn affidavit taken before a Greenland Justice of the Peace.
4924	
4925	In addition to those fine engravings from Garnery, there are two
4926	other French engravings worthy of note, by some one who subscribes
4927	himself H.  Durand.  One of them, though not precisely adapted to
4928	our present purpose, nevertheless deserves mention on other accounts.
4929	It is a quiet noon-scene among the isles of the Pacific; a French
4930	whaler anchored, inshore, in a calm, and lazily taking water on
4931	board; the loosened sails of the ship, and the long leaves of the
4932	palms in the background, both drooping together in the breezeless
4933	air.  The effect is very fine, when considered with reference to its
4934	presenting the hardy fishermen under one of their few aspects of
4935	oriental repose.  The other engraving is quite a different affair:
4936	the ship hove-to upon the open sea, and in the very heart of the
4937	Leviathanic life, with a Right Whale alongside; the vessel (in the
4938	act of cutting-in) hove over to the monster as if to a quay; and a
4939	boat, hurriedly pushing off from this scene of activity, is about
4940	giving chase to whales in the distance.  The harpoons and lances lie
4941	levelled for use; three oarsmen are just setting the mast in its
4942	hole; while from a sudden roll of the sea, the little craft stands
4943	half-erect out of the water, like a rearing horse.  From the ship,
4944	the smoke of the torments of the boiling whale is going up like the
4945	smoke over a village of smithies; and to windward, a black cloud,
4946	rising up with earnest of squalls and rains, seems to quicken the
4947	activity of the excited seamen.

4955	
4956	
4957	On Tower-hill, as you go down to the London docks, you may have seen
4958	a crippled beggar (or KEDGER, as the sailors say) holding a painted
4959	board before him, representing the tragic scene in which he lost his
4960	leg.  There are three whales and three boats; and one of the boats
4961	(presumed to contain the missing leg in all its original integrity)
4962	is being crunched by the jaws of the foremost whale.  Any time these
4963	ten years, they tell me, has that man held up that picture, and
4964	exhibited that stump to an incredulous world.  But the time of his
4965	justification has now come.  His three whales are as good whales as
4966	were ever published in Wapping, at any rate; and his stump as
4967	unquestionable a stump as any you will find in the western clearings.
4968	But, though for ever mounted on that stump, never a stump-speech
4969	does the poor whaleman make; but, with downcast eyes, stands ruefully
4970	contemplating his own amputation.
4971	
4972	Throughout the Pacific, and also in Nantucket, and New Bedford, and
4973	Sag Harbor, you will come across lively sketches of whales and
4974	whaling-scenes, graven by the fishermen themselves on Sperm
4975	Whale-teeth, or ladies' busks wrought out of the Right Whale-bone,
4976	and other like skrimshander articles, as the whalemen call the
4977	numerous little ingenious contrivances they elaborately carve out of
4978	the rough material, in their hours of ocean leisure.  Some of them
4979	have little boxes of dentistical-looking implements, specially
4980	intended for the skrimshandering business.  But, in general, they
4981	toil with their jack-knives alone; and, with that almost omnipotent
4982	tool of the sailor, they will turn you out anything you please, in
4983	the way of a mariner's fancy.
4984	
4985	Long exile from Christendom and civilization inevitably restores a
4986	man to that condition in which God placed him, i.e. what is called
4987	savagery.  Your true whale-hunter is as much a savage as an Iroquois.
4988	I myself am a savage, owning no allegiance but to the King of the
4989	Cannibals; and ready at any moment to rebel against him.
4990	
4991	Now, one of the peculiar characteristics of the savage in his
4992	domestic hours, is his wonderful patience of industry.  An ancient
4993	Hawaiian war-club or spear-paddle, in its full multiplicity and
4994	elaboration of carving, is as great a trophy of human perseverance as
4995	a Latin lexicon.  For, with but a bit of broken sea-shell or a
4996	shark's tooth, that miraculous intricacy of wooden net-work has been
4997	achieved; and it has cost steady years of steady application.
4998	
4999	As with the Hawaiian savage, so with the white sailor-savage.  With
5000	the same marvellous patience, and with the same single shark's tooth,
5001	of his one poor jack-knife, he will carve you a bit of bone
5002	sculpture, not quite as workmanlike, but as close packed in its
5003	maziness of design, as the Greek savage, Achilles's shield; and full
5004	of barbaric spirit and suggestiveness, as the prints of that fine old
5005	Dutch savage, Albert Durer.
5006	
5007	Wooden whales, or whales cut in profile out of the small dark slabs
5008	of the noble South Sea war-wood, are frequently met with in the
5009	forecastles of American whalers.  Some of them are done with much
5010	accuracy.
5011	
5012	At some old gable-roofed country houses you will see brass whales
5013	hung by the tail for knockers to the road-side door.  When the porter
5014	is sleepy, the anvil-headed whale would be best.  But these knocking
5015	whales are seldom remarkable as faithful essays.  On the spires of
5016	some old-fashioned churches you will see sheet-iron whales placed
5017	there for weather-cocks; but they are so elevated, and besides that
5018	are to all intents and purposes so labelled with HANDS OFF! you
5019	cannot examine them closely enough to decide upon their merit.
5020	
5021	In bony, ribby regions of the earth, where at the base of high broken
5022	cliffs masses of rock lie strewn in fantastic groupings upon the
5023	plain, you will often discover images as of the petrified forms of
5024	the Leviathan partly merged in grass, which of a windy day breaks
5025	against them in a surf of green surges.
5026	
5027	Then, again, in mountainous countries where the traveller is
5028	continually girdled by amphitheatrical heights; here and there from
5029	some lucky point of view you will catch passing glimpses of the
5030	profiles of whales defined along the undulating ridges.  But you must
5031	be a thorough whaleman, to see these sights; and not only that, but
5032	if you wish to return to such a sight again, you must be sure and
5033	take the exact intersecting latitude and longitude of your first
5034	stand-point, else so chance-like are such observations of the hills,
5035	that your precise, previous stand-point would require a laborious
5036	re-discovery; like the Soloma Islands, which still remain incognita,
5037	though once high-ruffed Mendanna trod them and old Figuera
5038	chronicled them.
5039	
5040	Nor when expandingly lifted by your subject, can you fail to trace
5041	out great whales in the starry heavens, and boats in pursuit of them;
5042	as when long filled with thoughts of war the Eastern nations saw
5043	armies locked in battle among the clouds.  Thus at the North have I
5044	chased Leviathan round and round the Pole with the revolutions of the
5045	bright points that first defined him to me.  And beneath the
5046	effulgent Antarctic skies I have boarded the Argo-Navis, and joined
5047	the chase against the starry Cetus far beyond the utmost stretch of
5048	Hydrus and the Flying Fish.
5049	
5050	With a frigate's anchors for my bridle-bitts and fasces of harpoons
5051	for spurs, would I could mount that whale and leap the topmost skies,
5052	to see whether the fabled heavens with all their countless tents
5053	really lie encamped beyond my mortal sight!
5054	
5055	
5056	
5057	CHAPTER 58
5058	
5059	Brit.
5060	
5061	
5062	Steering north-eastward from the Crozetts, we fell in with vast
5063	meadows of brit, the minute, yellow substance, upon which the Right
5064	Whale largely feeds.  For leagues and leagues it undulated round us,
5065	so that we seemed to be sailing through boundless fields of ripe and
5066	golden wheat.
5067	
5068	On the second day, numbers of Right Whales were seen, who, secure
5069	from the attack of a Sperm Whaler like the Pequod, with open jaws
5070	sluggishly swam through the brit, which, adhering to the fringing
5071	fibres of that wondrous Venetian blind in their mouths, was in that
5072	manner separated from the water that escaped at the lip.
5073	
5074	As morning mowers, who side by side slowly and seethingly advance
5075	their scythes through the long wet grass of marshy meads; even so
5076	these monsters swam, making a strange, grassy, cutting sound; and
5077	leaving behind them endless swaths of blue upon the yellow sea.*
5078	
5079	
5080	*That part of the sea known among whalemen as the Brazil Banks does
5081	not bear that name as the Banks of Newfoundland do, because of there
5082	being shallows and soundings there, but because of this remarkable
5083	meadow-like appearance, caused by the vast drifts of brit continually
5084	floating in those latitudes, where the Right Whale is often chased.
5085	
5086	
5087	But it was only the sound they made as they parted the brit which at
5088	all reminded one of mowers.  Seen from the mast-heads, especially
5089	when they paused and were stationary for a while, their vast black
5090	forms looked more like lifeless masses of rock than anything else.
5091	And as in the great hunting countries of India, the stranger at a
5092	distance will sometimes pass on the plains recumbent elephants
5093	without knowing them to be such, taking them for bare, blackened
5094	elevations of the soil; even so, often, with him, who for the first
5095	time beholds this species of the leviathans of the sea.  And even
5096	when recognised at last, their immense magnitude renders it very
5097	hard really to believe that such bulky masses of overgrowth can
5098	possibly be instinct, in all parts, with the same sort of life that
5099	lives in a dog or a horse.
5100	
5101	Indeed, in other respects, you can hardly regard any creatures of the
5102	deep with the same feelings that you do those of the shore.  For
5103	though some old naturalists have maintained that all creatures of the
5104	land are of their kind in the sea; and though taking a broad general
5105	view of the thing, this may very well be; yet coming to specialties,
5106	where, for example, does the ocean furnish any fish that in
5107	disposition answers to the sagacious kindness of the dog?  The
5108	accursed shark alone can in any generic respect be said to bear
5109	comparative analogy to him.
5110	
5111	But though, to landsmen in general, the native inhabitants of the
5112	seas have ever been regarded with emotions unspeakably unsocial and
5113	repelling; though we know the sea to be an everlasting terra
5114	incognita, so that Columbus sailed over numberless unknown worlds to
5115	discover his one superficial western one; though, by vast odds, the
5116	most terrific of all mortal disasters have immemorially and
5117	indiscriminately befallen tens and hundreds of thousands of those who
5118	have gone upon the waters; though but a moment's consideration will
5119	teach, that however baby man may brag of his science and skill, and
5120	however much, in a flattering future, that science and skill may
5121	augment; yet for ever and for ever, to the crack of doom, the sea
5122	will insult and murder him, and pulverize the stateliest, stiffest
5123	frigate he can make; nevertheless, by the continual repetition of
5124	these very impressions, man has lost that sense of the full awfulness
5125	of the sea which aboriginally belongs to it.
5126	
5127	The first boat we read of, floated on an ocean, that with Portuguese
5128	vengeance had whelmed a whole world without leaving so much as a
5129	widow.  That same ocean rolls now; that same ocean destroyed the
5130	wrecked ships of last year.  Yea, foolish mortals, Noah's flood is
5131	not yet subsided; two thirds of the fair world it yet covers.
5132	
5133	Wherein differ the sea and the land, that a miracle upon one is not a
5134	miracle upon the other?  Preternatural terrors rested upon the
5135	Hebrews, when under the feet of Korah and his company the live ground
5136	opened and swallowed them up for ever; yet not a modern sun ever
5137	sets, but in precisely the same manner the live sea swallows up ships
5138	and crews.
5139	
5140	But not only is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien to it, but
5141	it is also a fiend to its own off-spring; worse than the Persian host
5142	who murdered his own guests; sparing not the creatures which itself
5143	hath spawned.  Like a savage tigress that tossing in the jungle
5144	overlays her own cubs, so the sea dashes even the mightiest whales
5145	against the rocks, and leaves them there side by side with the split
5146	wrecks of ships.  No mercy, no power but its own controls it.
5147	Panting and snorting like a mad battle steed that has lost its rider,
5148	the masterless ocean overruns the globe.
5149	
5150	Consider the subtleness of the sea; how its most dreaded creatures
5151	glide under water, unapparent for the most part, and treacherously
5152	hidden beneath the loveliest tints of azure.  Consider also the
5153	devilish brilliance and beauty of many of its most remorseless
5154	tribes, as the dainty embellished shape of many species of sharks.
5155	Consider, once more, the universal cannibalism of the sea; all whose
5156	creatures prey upon each other, carrying on eternal war since the
5157	world began.
5158	
5159	Consider all this; and then turn to this green, gentle, and most
5160	docile earth; consider them both, the sea and the land; and do you
5161	not find a strange analogy to something in yourself?  For as this
5162	appalling ocean surrounds the verdant land, so in the soul of man
5163	there lies one insular Tahiti, full of peace and joy, but encompassed
5164	by all the horrors of the half known life.  God keep thee!  Push not
5165	off from that isle, thou canst never return!
5166	
5167	
5168	CHAPTER 59
5169	
5170	Squid.
5171	
5172	
5173	Slowly wading through the meadows of brit, the Pequod still held on
5174	her way north-eastward towards the island of Java; a gentle air
5175	impelling her keel, so that in the surrounding serenity her three
5176	tall tapering masts mildly waved to that languid breeze, as three
5177	mild palms on a plain.  And still, at wide intervals in the silvery
5178	night, the lonely, alluring jet would be seen.
5179	
5180	But one transparent blue morning, when a stillness almost
5181	preternatural spread over the sea, however unattended with any
5182	stagnant calm; when the long burnished sun-glade on the waters seemed
5183	a golden finger laid across them, enjoining some secrecy; when the
5184	slippered waves whispered together as they softly ran on; in this
5185	profound hush of the visible sphere a strange spectre was seen by
5186	Daggoo from the main-mast-head.
5187	
5188	In the distance, a great white mass lazily rose, and rising higher
5189	and higher, and disentangling itself from the azure, at last gleamed
5190	before our prow like a snow-slide, new slid from the hills.  Thus
5191	glistening for a moment, as slowly it subsided, and sank.  Then once
5192	more arose, and silently gleamed.  It seemed not a whale; and yet is
5193	this Moby Dick? thought Daggoo.  Again the phantom went down, but on
5194	re-appearing once more, with a stiletto-like cry that startled every
5195	"man from his nod, the negro yelled out--There! there again! there
she breaches! right ahead!  The White Whale, the White Whale!"
5196	
5197	Upon this, the seamen rushed to the yard-arms, as in swarming-time
5198	the bees rush to the boughs.  Bare-headed in the sultry sun, Ahab
5199	stood on the bowsprit, and with one hand pushed far behind in
5200	readiness to wave his orders to the helmsman, cast his eager glance
5201	in the direction indicated aloft by the outstretched motionless arm
5202	of Daggoo.
5203	
5204	Whether the flitting attendance of the one still and solitary jet had
5205	gradually worked upon Ahab, so that he was now prepared to connect
5206	the ideas of mildness and repose with the first sight of the
5207	particular whale he pursued; however this was, or whether his
5208	eagerness betrayed him; whichever way it might have been, no sooner
5209	did he distinctly perceive the white mass, than with a quick
5210	intensity he instantly gave orders for lowering.
5211	
5212	The four boats were soon on the water; Ahab's in advance, and all
5213	swiftly pulling towards their prey.  Soon it went down, and while,
5214	with oars suspended, we were awaiting its reappearance, lo! in the
5215	same spot where it sank, once more it slowly rose.  Almost forgetting
5216	for the moment all thoughts of Moby Dick, we now gazed at the most
5217	wondrous phenomenon which the secret seas have hitherto revealed to
5218	mankind.  A vast pulpy mass, furlongs in length and breadth, of a
5219	glancing cream-colour, lay floating on the water, innumerable long
5220	arms radiating from its centre, and curling and twisting like a nest
5221	of anacondas, as if blindly to clutch at any hapless object within
5222	reach.  No perceptible face or front did it have; no conceivable
5223	token of either sensation or instinct; but undulated there on the
5224	billows, an unearthly, formless, chance-like apparition of life.
5225	
5226	As with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again, Starbuck
5227	still gazing at the agitated waters where it had sunk, with a wild
5228	"voice exclaimed--Almost rather had I seen Moby Dick and fought him,
than to have seen thee, thou white ghost!"
5229	
5230	What was it, Sir? said Flask.
5231	
5232	"The great live squid, which, they say, few whale-ships ever beheld,
and returned to their ports to tell of it."
5233	
5234	But Ahab said nothing; turning his boat, he sailed back to the
5235	vessel; the rest as silently following.
5236	
5237	Whatever superstitions the sperm whalemen in general have connected
5238	with the sight of this object, certain it is, that a glimpse of it
5239	being so very unusual, that circumstance has gone far to invest it
5240	with portentousness.  So rarely is it beheld, that though one and all
5241	of them declare it to be the largest animated thing in the ocean, yet
5242	very few of them have any but the most vague ideas concerning its
5243	true nature and form; notwithstanding, they believe it to furnish to
5244	the sperm whale his only food.  For though other species of whales
5245	find their food above water, and may be seen by man in the act of
5246	feeding, the spermaceti whale obtains his whole food in unknown zones
5247	below the surface; and only by inference is it that any one can tell
5248	of what, precisely, that food consists.  At times, when closely
5249	pursued, he will disgorge what are supposed to be the detached arms
5250	of the squid; some of them thus exhibited exceeding twenty and thirty
5251	feet in length.  They fancy that the monster to which these arms
5252	belonged ordinarily clings by them to the bed of the ocean; and that
5253	the sperm whale, unlike other species, is supplied with teeth in
5254	order to attack and tear it.
5255	
5256	There seems some ground to imagine that the great Kraken of Bishop
5257	Pontoppodan may ultimately resolve itself into Squid.  The manner in
5258	which the Bishop describes it, as alternately rising and sinking,
5259	with some other particulars he narrates, in all this the two
5260	correspond.  But much abatement is necessary with respect to the
5261	incredible bulk he assigns it.
5262	
5263	By some naturalists who have vaguely heard rumors of the mysterious
5264	creature, here spoken of, it is included among the class of
5265	cuttle-fish, to which, indeed, in certain external respects it would
5266	seem to belong, but only as the Anak of the tribe.

5271	
5272	The Line.
5273	
5274	
5275	With reference to the whaling scene shortly to be described, as well
5276	as for the better understanding of all similar scenes elsewhere
5277	presented, I have here to speak of the magical, sometimes horrible
5278	whale-line.
5279	
5280	The line originally used in the fishery was of the best hemp,
5281	slightly vapoured with tar, not impregnated with it, as in the case of
5282	ordinary ropes; for while tar, as ordinarily used, makes the hemp
5283	more pliable to the rope-maker, and also renders the rope itself more
5284	convenient to the sailor for common ship use; yet, not only would the
5285	ordinary quantity too much stiffen the whale-line for the close
5286	coiling to which it must be subjected; but as most seamen are
5287	beginning to learn, tar in general by no means adds to the rope's
5288	durability or strength, however much it may give it compactness and
5289	gloss.
5290	
5291	Of late years the Manilla rope has in the American fishery almost
5292	entirely superseded hemp as a material for whale-lines; for, though
5293	not so durable as hemp, it is stronger, and far more soft and
5294	elastic; and I will add (since there is an aesthetics in all things),
5295	is much more handsome and becoming to the boat, than hemp.  Hemp is a
5296	dusky, dark fellow, a sort of Indian; but Manilla is as a
5297	golden-haired Circassian to behold.
5298	
5299	The whale-line is only two-thirds of an inch in thickness.  At first
5300	sight, you would not think it so strong as it really is.  By
5301	experiment its one and fifty yarns will each suspend a weight of one
5302	hundred and twenty pounds; so that the whole rope will bear a strain
5303	nearly equal to three tons.  In length, the common sperm whale-line
5304	measures something over two hundred fathoms.  Towards the stern of
5305	the boat it is spirally coiled away in the tub, not like the
5306	worm-pipe of a still though, but so as to form one round,
5307	cheese-shaped mass of densely bedded sheaves, or layers of
5308	concentric spiralizations, without any hollow but the heart, or
5309	minute vertical tube formed at the axis of the cheese.  As the least
5310	tangle or kink in the coiling would, in running out, infallibly take
5311	somebody's arm, leg, or entire body off, the utmost precaution is
5312	used in stowing the line in its tub.  Some harpooneers will consume
5313	almost an entire morning in this business, carrying the line high
5314	aloft and then reeving it downwards through a block towards the tub,
5315	so as in the act of coiling to free it from all possible wrinkles and
5316	twists.
5317	
5318	In the English boats two tubs are used instead of one; the same line
5319	being continuously coiled in both tubs.  There is some advantage in
5320	this; because these twin-tubs being so small they fit more readily
5321	into the boat, and do not strain it so much; whereas, the American
5322	tub, nearly three feet in diameter and of proportionate depth, makes
5323	a rather bulky freight for a craft whose planks are but one half-inch
5324	in thickness; for the bottom of the whale-boat is like critical ice,
5325	which will bear up a considerable distributed weight, but not very
5326	much of a concentrated one.  When the painted canvas cover is clapped
5327	on the American line-tub, the boat looks as if it were pulling off
5328	with a prodigious great wedding-cake to present to the whales.
5329	
5330	Both ends of the line are exposed; the lower end terminating in an
5331	eye-splice or loop coming up from the bottom against the side of the
5332	tub, and hanging over its edge completely disengaged from everything.
5333	This arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two accounts.
5334	First: In order to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional
5335	line from a neighboring boat, in case the stricken whale should sound
5336	so deep as to threaten to carry off the entire line originally
5337	attached to the harpoon.  In these instances, the whale of course is
5338	shifted like a mug of ale, as it were, from the one boat to the
5339	other; though the first boat always hovers at hand to assist its
5340	consort.  Second: This arrangement is indispensable for common
5341	safety's sake; for were the lower end of the line in any way attached
5342	to the boat, and were the whale then to run the line out to the end
5343	almost in a single, smoking minute as he sometimes does, he would not
5344	stop there, for the doomed boat would infallibly be dragged down
5345	after him into the profundity of the sea; and in that case no
5346	town-crier would ever find her again.
5347	
5348	Before lowering the boat for the chase, the upper end of the line is
5349	taken aft from the tub, and passing round the loggerhead there, is
5350	again carried forward the entire length of the boat, resting
5351	crosswise upon the loom or handle of every man's oar, so that it jogs
5352	against his wrist in rowing; and also passing between the men, as
5353	they alternately sit at the opposite gunwales, to the leaded chocks
5354	or grooves in the extreme pointed prow of the boat, where a wooden
5355	pin or skewer the size of a common quill, prevents it from slipping
5356	out.  From the chocks it hangs in a slight festoon over the bows, and
5357	is then passed inside the boat again; and some ten or twenty fathoms
5358	(called box-line) being coiled upon the box in the bows, it continues
5359	its way to the gunwale still a little further aft, and is then
5360	attached to the short-warp--the rope which is immediately connected
5361	with the harpoon; but previous to that connexion, the short-warp goes
5362	through sundry mystifications too tedious to detail.
5363	
5364	Thus the whale-line folds the whole boat in its complicated coils,
5365	twisting and writhing around it in almost every direction.  All the
5366	oarsmen are involved in its perilous contortions; so that to the
5367	timid eye of the landsman, they seem as Indian jugglers, with the
5368	deadliest snakes sportively festooning their limbs.  Nor can any son
5369	of mortal woman, for the first time, seat himself amid those hempen
5370	intricacies, and while straining his utmost at the oar, bethink him
5371	that at any unknown instant the harpoon may be darted, and all these
5372	horrible contortions be put in play like ringed lightnings; he cannot
5373	be thus circumstanced without a shudder that makes the very marrow in
5374	his bones to quiver in him like a shaken jelly.  Yet habit--strange
5375	thing! what cannot habit accomplish?--Gayer sallies, more merry
5376	mirth, better jokes, and brighter repartees, you never heard over
5377	your mahogany, than you will hear over the half-inch white cedar of
5378	the whale-boat, when thus hung in hangman's nooses; and, like the six
5379	burghers of Calais before King Edward, the six men composing the crew
5380	pull into the jaws of death, with a halter around every neck, as you
5381	may say.
5382	
5383	Perhaps a very little thought will now enable you to account for
5384	those repeated whaling disasters--some few of which are casually
5385	chronicled--of this man or that man being taken out of the boat by
5386	the line, and lost.  For, when the line is darting out, to be seated
5387	then in the boat, is like being seated in the midst of the manifold
5388	whizzings of a steam-engine in full play, when every flying beam, and
5389	shaft, and wheel, is grazing you.  It is worse; for you cannot sit
5390	motionless in the heart of these perils, because the boat is rocking
5391	like a cradle, and you are pitched one way and the other, without the
5392	slightest warning; and only by a certain self-adjusting buoyancy and
5393	simultaneousness of volition and action, can you escape being made a
5394	Mazeppa of, and run away with where the all-seeing sun himself could
5395	never pierce you out.
5396	
5397	Again: as the profound calm which only apparently precedes and
5398	prophesies of the storm, is perhaps more awful than the storm itself;
5399	for, indeed, the calm is but the wrapper and envelope of the storm;
5400	and contains it in itself, as the seemingly harmless rifle holds the
5401	fatal powder, and the ball, and the explosion; so the graceful repose
5402	of the line, as it silently serpentines about the oarsmen before
5403	being brought into actual play--this is a thing which carries more of
5404	true terror than any other aspect of this dangerous affair.  But why
5405	say more?  All men live enveloped in whale-lines.  All are born with
5406	halters round their necks; but it is only when caught in the swift,
5407	sudden turn of death, that mortals realize the silent, subtle,
5408	ever-present perils of life.  And if you be a philosopher, though
5409	seated in the whale-boat, you would not at heart feel one whit more
5410	of terror, than though seated before your evening fire with a poker,
5411	and not a harpoon, by your side.

5415	CHAPTER 61
5416	
5417	Stubb Kills a Whale.
5418	
5419	
5420	If to Starbuck the apparition of the Squid was a thing of portents,
5421	to Queequeg it was quite a different object.
5422	
5423	When you see him 'quid, said the savage, honing his harpoon in the
5424	bow of his hoisted boat, then you quick see him 'parm whale.
5425	
5426	The next day was exceedingly still and sultry, and with nothing
5427	special to engage them, the Pequod's crew could hardly resist the
5428	spell of sleep induced by such a vacant sea.  For this part of the
5429	Indian Ocean through which we then were voyaging is not what whalemen
5430	call a lively ground; that is, it affords fewer glimpses of
5431	porpoises, dolphins, flying-fish, and other vivacious denizens of
5432	more stirring waters, than those off the Rio de la Plata, or the
5433	in-shore ground off Peru.
5434	
5435	It was my turn to stand at the foremast-head; and with my shoulders
5436	leaning against the slackened royal shrouds, to and fro I idly swayed
5437	in what seemed an enchanted air.  No resolution could withstand it;
5438	in that dreamy mood losing all consciousness, at last my soul went
5439	out of my body; though my body still continued to sway as a pendulum
5440	will, long after the power which first moved it is withdrawn.
5441	
5442	Ere forgetfulness altogether came over me, I had noticed that the
5443	seamen at the main and mizzen-mast-heads were already drowsy.  So
5444	that at last all three of us lifelessly swung from the spars, and for
5445	every swing that we made there was a nod from below from the
5446	slumbering helmsman.  The waves, too, nodded their indolent crests;
5447	and across the wide trance of the sea, east nodded to west, and the
5448	sun over all.
5449	
5450	Suddenly bubbles seemed bursting beneath my closed eyes; like vices
5451	my hands grasped the shrouds; some invisible, gracious agency
5452	preserved me; with a shock I came back to life.  And lo! close under
5453	our lee, not forty fathoms off, a gigantic Sperm Whale lay rolling in
5454	the water like the capsized hull of a frigate, his broad, glossy
5455	back, of an Ethiopian hue, glistening in the sun's rays like a
5456	mirror.  But lazily undulating in the trough of the sea, and ever and
5457	anon tranquilly spouting his vapoury jet, the whale looked like a
5458	portly burgher smoking his pipe of a warm afternoon.  But that pipe,
5459	poor whale, was thy last.  As if struck by some enchanter's wand, the
5460	sleepy ship and every sleeper in it all at once started into
5461	wakefulness; and more than a score of voices from all parts of the
5462	vessel, simultaneously with the three notes from aloft, shouted forth
5463	the accustomed cry, as the great fish slowly and regularly spouted
5464	the sparkling brine into the air.
5465	
5466	Clear away the boats!  Luff! cried Ahab.  And obeying his own
5467	order, he dashed the helm down before the helmsman could handle the
5468	spokes.
5469	
5470	The sudden exclamations of the crew must have alarmed the whale; and
5471	ere the boats were down, majestically turning, he swam away to the
5472	leeward, but with such a steady tranquillity, and making so few
5473	ripples as he swam, that thinking after all he might not as yet be
5474	alarmed, Ahab gave orders that not an oar should be used, and no man
5475	must speak but in whispers.  So seated like Ontario Indians on the
5476	gunwales of the boats, we swiftly but silently paddled along; the
5477	calm not admitting of the noiseless sails being set.  Presently, as
5478	we thus glided in chase, the monster perpendicularly flitted his tail
5479	forty feet into the air, and then sank out of sight like a tower
5480	swallowed up.
5481	
5482	There go flukes! was the cry, an announcement immediately followed
5483	by Stubb's producing his match and igniting his pipe, for now a
5484	respite was granted.  After the full interval of his sounding had
5485	elapsed, the whale rose again, and being now in advance of the
5486	smoker's boat, and much nearer to it than to any of the others, Stubb
5487	counted upon the honour of the capture.  It was obvious, now, that the
5488	whale had at length become aware of his pursuers.  All silence of
5489	cautiousness was therefore no longer of use.  Paddles were dropped,
5490	and oars came loudly into play.  And still puffing at his pipe, Stubb
5491	cheered on his crew to the assault.
5492	
5493	Yes, a mighty change had come over the fish.  All alive to his
5494	jeopardy, he was going head out; that part obliquely projecting
5495	from the mad yeast which he brewed.*
5496	
5497	
5498	*It will be seen in some other place of what a very light substance
5499	the entire interior of the sperm whale's enormous head consists.
5500	Though apparently the most massive, it is by far the most buoyant
5501	part about him.  So that with ease he elevates it in the air, and
5502	invariably does so when going at his utmost speed.  Besides, such is
5503	the breadth of the upper part of the front of his head, and such the
5504	tapering cut-water formation of the lower part, that by obliquely
5505	elevating his head, he thereby may be said to transform himself from
5506	a bluff-bowed sluggish galliot into a sharppointed New York
5507	pilot-boat.
5508	
5509	
5510	"Start her, start her, my men!  Don't hurry yourselves; take plenty
of time--but start her; start her like thunder-claps, that's all,"
5511	"cried Stubb, spluttering out the smoke as he spoke.  Start her, now;
give 'em the long and strong stroke, Tashtego.  Start her, Tash, my
boy--start her, all; but keep cool, keep cool--cucumbers is the
word--easy, easy--only start her like grim death and grinning devils,
and raise the buried dead perpendicular out of their graves,
boys--that's all.  Start her!"
5512	
5513	Woo-hoo!  Wa-hee! screamed the Gay-Header in reply, raising some
5514	old war-whoop to the skies; as every oarsman in the strained boat
5515	involuntarily bounced forward with the one tremendous leading stroke
5516	which the eager Indian gave.
5517	
5518	But his wild screams were answered by others quite as wild.
5519	Kee-hee!  Kee-hee! yelled Daggoo, straining forwards and backwards
5520	on his seat, like a pacing tiger in his cage.
5521	
5522	Ka-la!  Koo-loo! howled Queequeg, as if smacking his lips over a
5523	mouthful of Grenadier's steak.  And thus with oars and yells the
5524	keels cut the sea.  Meanwhile, Stubb retaining his place in the
5525	van, still encouraged his men to the onset, all the while puffing the
5526	smoke from his mouth.  Like desperadoes they tugged and they
5527	"strained, till the welcome cry was heard--Stand up, Tashtego!--give
it to him!  The harpoon was hurled.  Stern all!  The oarsmen"
5528	backed water; the same moment something went hot and hissing along
5529	every one of their wrists.  It was the magical line.  An instant
5530	before, Stubb had swiftly caught two additional turns with it round
5531	the loggerhead, whence, by reason of its increased rapid circlings, a
5532	hempen blue smoke now jetted up and mingled with the steady fumes
5533	from his pipe.  As the line passed round and round the loggerhead; so
5534	also, just before reaching that point, it blisteringly passed through
5535	and through both of Stubb's hands, from which the hand-cloths, or
5536	squares of quilted canvas sometimes worn at these times, had
5537	accidentally dropped.  It was like holding an enemy's sharp two-edged
5538	sword by the blade, and that enemy all the time striving to wrest it
5539	out of your clutch.
5540	
5541	Wet the line! wet the line! cried Stubb to the tub oarsman (him
5542	seated by the tub) who, snatching off his hat, dashed sea-water into
5543	it.*  More turns were taken, so that the line began holding its place.
5544	The boat now flew through the boiling water like a shark all fins.
5545	Stubb and Tashtego here changed places--stem for stern--a staggering
5546	business truly in that rocking commotion.
5547	
5548	
5549	*Partly to show the indispensableness of this act, it may here be
5550	stated, that, in the old Dutch fishery, a mop was used to dash the
5551	running line with water; in many other ships, a wooden piggin, or
5552	bailer, is set apart for that purpose.  Your hat, however, is the
5553	most convenient.
5554	
5555	
5556	From the vibrating line extending the entire length of the upper part
5557	of the boat, and from its now being more tight than a harpstring, you
5558	would have thought the craft had two keels--one cleaving the water,
5559	the other the air--as the boat churned on through both opposing
5560	elements at once.  A continual cascade played at the bows; a
5561	ceaseless whirling eddy in her wake; and, at the slightest motion
5562	from within, even but of a little finger, the vibrating, cracking
5563	craft canted over her spasmodic gunwale into the sea.  Thus they
5564	rushed; each man with might and main clinging to his seat, to prevent
5565	being tossed to the foam; and the tall form of Tashtego at the
5566	steering oar crouching almost double, in order to bring down his
5567	centre of gravity.  Whole Atlantics and Pacifics seemed passed as
5568	they shot on their way, till at length the whale somewhat slackened
5569	his flight.
5570	
5571	Haul in--haul in! cried Stubb to the bowsman! and, facing round
5572	towards the whale, all hands began pulling the boat up to him, while
5573	yet the boat was being towed on.  Soon ranging up by his flank,
5574	Stubb, firmly planting his knee in the clumsy cleat, darted dart
5575	after dart into the flying fish; at the word of command, the boat
5576	alternately sterning out of the way of the whale's horrible wallow,
5577	and then ranging up for another fling.
5578	
5579	The red tide now poured from all sides of the monster like brooks
5580	down a hill.  His tormented body rolled not in brine but in blood,
5581	which bubbled and seethed for furlongs behind in their wake.  The
5582	slanting sun playing upon this crimson pond in the sea, sent back
5583	its reflection into every face, so that they all glowed to each other
5584	like red men.  And all the while, jet after jet of white smoke was
5585	agonizingly shot from the spiracle of the whale, and vehement puff
5586	after puff from the mouth of the excited headsman; as at every dart,
5587	hauling in upon his crooked lance (by the line attached to it), Stubb
5588	straightened it again and again, by a few rapid blows against the
5589	gunwale, then again and again sent it into the whale.
5590	
5591	Pull up--pull up! he now cried to the bowsman, as the waning whale
5592	relaxed in his wrath.  Pull up!--close to! and the boat ranged
5593	along the fish's flank.  When reaching far over the bow, Stubb slowly
5594	churned his long sharp lance into the fish, and kept it there,
5595	carefully churning and churning, as if cautiously seeking to feel
5596	after some gold watch that the whale might have swallowed, and which
5597	he was fearful of breaking ere he could hook it out.  But that gold
5598	watch he sought was the innermost life of the fish.  And now it is
5599	struck; for, starting from his trance into that unspeakable thing
5600	called his flurry, the monster horribly wallowed in his blood,
5601	overwrapped himself in impenetrable, mad, boiling spray, so that the
5602	imperilled craft, instantly dropping astern, had much ado blindly to
5603	struggle out from that phrensied twilight into the clear air of the
5604	day.
5605	
5606	And now abating in his flurry, the whale once more rolled out into
5607	view; surging from side to side; spasmodically dilating and
5608	contracting his spout-hole, with sharp, cracking, agonized
5609	respirations.  At last, gush after gush of clotted red gore, as if it
5610	had been the purple lees of red wine, shot into the frighted air; and
5611	falling back again, ran dripping down his motionless flanks into
5612	the sea.  His heart had burst!
5613	
5614	He's dead, Mr. Stubb, said Daggoo.
5615	
5616	Yes; both pipes smoked out! and withdrawing his own from his mouth,
5617	Stubb scattered the dead ashes over the water; and, for a moment,
5618	stood thoughtfully eyeing the vast corpse he had made.
5619	
5620	
5621	
5622	CHAPTER 62
5623	
5624	The Dart.
5625	
5626	
5627	A word concerning an incident in the last chapter.
5628	
5629	According to the invariable usage of the fishery, the whale-boat
5630	pushes off from the ship, with the headsman or whale-killer as
5631	temporary steersman, and the harpooneer or whale-fastener pulling the
5632	foremost oar, the one known as the harpooneer-oar.  Now it needs a
5633	strong, nervous arm to strike the first iron into the fish; for
5634	often, in what is called a long dart, the heavy implement has to be
5635	flung to the distance of twenty or thirty feet.  But however
5636	prolonged and exhausting the chase, the harpooneer is expected to
5637	pull his oar meanwhile to the uttermost; indeed, he is expected to
5638	set an example of superhuman activity to the rest, not only by
5639	incredible rowing, but by repeated loud and intrepid exclamations;
5640	and what it is to keep shouting at the top of one's compass, while
5641	all the other muscles are strained and half started--what that is
5642	none know but those who have tried it.  For one, I cannot bawl very
5643	heartily and work very recklessly at one and the same time.  In this
5644	straining, bawling state, then, with his back to the fish, all at
5645	"once the exhausted harpooneer hears the exciting cry--Stand up, and
give it to him!  He now has to drop and secure his oar, turn round"
5646	on his centre half way, seize his harpoon from the crotch, and with
5647	what little strength may remain, he essays to pitch it somehow into
5648	the whale.  No wonder, taking the whole fleet of whalemen in a body,
5649	that out of fifty fair chances for a dart, not five are successful;
5650	no wonder that so many hapless harpooneers are madly cursed and
5651	disrated; no wonder that some of them actually burst their
5652	blood-vessels in the boat; no wonder that some sperm whalemen are
5653	absent four years with four barrels; no wonder that to many ship
5654	owners, whaling is but a losing concern; for it is the harpooneer
5655	that makes the voyage, and if you take the breath out of his body how
5656	can you expect to find it there when most wanted!
5657	
5658	Again, if the dart be successful, then at the second critical
5659	instant, that is, when the whale starts to run, the boatheader and
5660	harpooneer likewise start to running fore and aft, to the imminent
5661	jeopardy of themselves and every one else.  It is then they change
5662	places; and the headsman, the chief officer of the little craft,
5663	takes his proper station in the bows of the boat.
5664	
5665	Now, I care not who maintains the contrary, but all this is both
5666	foolish and unnecessary.  The headsman should stay in the bows from
5667	first to last; he should both dart the harpoon and the lance, and no
5668	rowing whatever should be expected of him, except under circumstances
5669	obvious to any fisherman.  I know that this would sometimes involve a
5670	slight loss of speed in the chase; but long experience in various
5671	whalemen of more than one nation has convinced me that in the vast
5672	majority of failures in the fishery, it has not by any means been so
5673	much the speed of the whale as the before described exhaustion of the
5674	harpooneer that has caused them.
5675	
5676	To insure the greatest efficiency in the dart, the harpooneers of
5677	this world must start to their feet from out of idleness, and not
5678	from out of toil.

5684	The Crotch.
5685	
5686	
5687	Out of the trunk, the branches grow; out of them, the twigs.  So, in
5688	productive subjects, grow the chapters.
5689	
5690	The crotch alluded to on a previous page deserves independent
5691	mention.  It is a notched stick of a peculiar form, some two feet in
5692	length, which is perpendicularly inserted into the starboard gunwale
5693	near the bow, for the purpose of furnishing a rest for the wooden
5694	extremity of the harpoon, whose other naked, barbed end slopingly
5695	projects from the prow.  Thereby the weapon is instantly at hand to
5696	its hurler, who snatches it up as readily from its rest as a
5697	backwoodsman swings his rifle from the wall.  It is customary to have
5698	two harpoons reposing in the crotch, respectively called the first
5699	and second irons.
5700	
5701	But these two harpoons, each by its own cord, are both connected with
5702	the line; the object being this: to dart them both, if possible, one
5703	instantly after the other into the same whale; so that if, in the
5704	coming drag, one should draw out, the other may still retain a hold.
5705	It is a doubling of the chances.  But it very often happens that
5706	owing to the instantaneous, violent, convulsive running of the whale
5707	upon receiving the first iron, it becomes impossible for the
5708	harpooneer, however lightning-like in his movements, to pitch the
5709	second iron into him.  Nevertheless, as the second iron is already
5710	connected with the line, and the line is running, hence that weapon
5711	must, at all events, be anticipatingly tossed out of the boat,
5712	somehow and somewhere; else the most terrible jeopardy would involve
5713	all hands.  Tumbled into the water, it accordingly is in such cases;
5714	the spare coils of box line (mentioned in a preceding chapter) making
5715	this feat, in most instances, prudently practicable.  But this
5716	critical act is not always unattended with the saddest and most fatal
5717	casualties.
5718	
5719	Furthermore: you must know that when the second iron is thrown
5720	overboard, it thenceforth becomes a dangling, sharp-edged terror,
5721	skittishly curvetting about both boat and whale, entangling the
5722	lines, or cutting them, and making a prodigious sensation in all
5723	directions.  Nor, in general, is it possible to secure it again until
5724	the whale is fairly captured and a corpse.
5725	
5726	Consider, now, how it must be in the case of four boats all engaging
5727	one unusually strong, active, and knowing whale; when owing to these
5728	qualities in him, as well as to the thousand concurring accidents of
5729	such an audacious enterprise, eight or ten loose second irons may be
5730	simultaneously dangling about him.  For, of course, each boat is
5731	supplied with several harpoons to bend on to the line should the
5732	first one be ineffectually darted without recovery.  All these
5733	particulars are faithfully narrated here, as they will not fail to
5734	elucidate several most important, however intricate passages, in
5735	scenes hereafter to be painted.

5739	CHAPTER 64
5740	
5741	Stubb's Supper.
5742	
5743	
5744	Stubb's whale had been killed some distance from the ship.  It was a
5745	calm; so, forming a tandem of three boats, we commenced the slow
5746	business of towing the trophy to the Pequod.  And now, as we eighteen
5747	men with our thirty-six arms, and one hundred and eighty thumbs and
5748	fingers, slowly toiled hour after hour upon that inert, sluggish
5749	corpse in the sea; and it seemed hardly to budge at all, except at
5750	long intervals; good evidence was hereby furnished of the
5751	enormousness of the mass we moved.  For, upon the great canal of
5752	Hang-Ho, or whatever they call it, in China, four or five laborers on
5753	the foot-path will draw a bulky freighted junk at the rate of a mile
5754	an hour; but this grand argosy we towed heavily forged along, as if
5755	laden with pig-lead in bulk.
5756	
5757	Darkness came on; but three lights up and down in the Pequod's
5758	main-rigging dimly guided our way; till drawing nearer we saw Ahab
5759	dropping one of several more lanterns over the bulwarks.  Vacantly
5760	eyeing the heaving whale for a moment, he issued the usual orders for
5761	securing it for the night, and then handing his lantern to a seaman,
5762	went his way into the cabin, and did not come forward again until
5763	morning.
5764	
5765	Though, in overseeing the pursuit of this whale, Captain Ahab had
5766	evinced his customary activity, to call it so; yet now that the
5767	creature was dead, some vague dissatisfaction, or impatience, or
5768	despair, seemed working in him; as if the sight of that dead body
5769	reminded him that Moby Dick was yet to be slain; and though a
5770	thousand other whales were brought to his ship, all that would not
5771	one jot advance his grand, monomaniac object.  Very soon you would
5772	have thought from the sound on the Pequod's decks, that all hands
5773	were preparing to cast anchor in the deep; for heavy chains are being
5774	dragged along the deck, and thrust rattling out of the port-holes.
5775	But by those clanking links, the vast corpse itself, not the ship, is
5776	to be moored.  Tied by the head to the stern, and by the tail to the
5777	bows, the whale now lies with its black hull close to the vessel's
5778	and seen through the darkness of the night, which obscured the spars
5779	and rigging aloft, the two--ship and whale, seemed yoked together
5780	like colossal bullocks, whereof one reclines while the other remains
5781	standing.*
5782	
5783	
5784	*A little item may as well be related here.  The strongest and most
5785	reliable hold which the ship has upon the whale when moored
5786	alongside, is by the flukes or tail; and as from its greater density
5787	that part is relatively heavier than any other (excepting the
5788	side-fins), its flexibility even in death, causes it to sink low
5789	beneath the surface; so that with the hand you cannot get at it from
5790	the boat, in order to put the chain round it.  But this difficulty is
5791	ingeniously overcome: a small, strong line is prepared with a wooden
5792	float at its outer end, and a weight in its middle, while the other
5793	end is secured to the ship.  By adroit management the wooden float is
5794	made to rise on the other side of the mass, so that now having
5795	girdled the whale, the chain is readily made to follow suit; and
5796	being slipped along the body, is at last locked fast round the
5797	smallest part of the tail, at the point of junction with its broad
5798	flukes or lobes.
5799	
5800	
5801	If moody Ahab was now all quiescence, at least so far as could be
5802	known on deck, Stubb, his second mate, flushed with conquest,
5803	betrayed an unusual but still good-natured excitement.  Such an
5804	unwonted bustle was he in that the staid Starbuck, his official
5805	superior, quietly resigned to him for the time the sole management of
5806	affairs.  One small, helping cause of all this liveliness in Stubb,
5807	was soon made strangely manifest.  Stubb was a high liver; he was
5808	somewhat intemperately fond of the whale as a flavorish thing to his
5809	palate.
5810	
5811	"A steak, a steak, ere I sleep!  You, Daggoo! overboard you go, and
cut me one from his small!"
5812	
5813	Here be it known, that though these wild fishermen do not, as a
5814	general thing, and according to the great military maxim, make the
5815	enemy defray the current expenses of the war (at least before
5816	realizing the proceeds of the voyage), yet now and then you find some
5817	of these Nantucketers who have a genuine relish for that particular
5818	part of the Sperm Whale designated by Stubb; comprising the tapering
5819	extremity of the body.
5820	
5821	About midnight that steak was cut and cooked; and lighted by two
5822	lanterns of sperm oil, Stubb stoutly stood up to his spermaceti
5823	supper at the capstan-head, as if that capstan were a sideboard.  Nor
5824	was Stubb the only banqueter on whale's flesh that night.  Mingling
5825	their mumblings with his own mastications, thousands on thousands of
5826	sharks, swarming round the dead leviathan, smackingly feasted on its
5827	fatness.  The few sleepers below in their bunks were often startled
5828	by the sharp slapping of their tails against the hull, within a few
5829	inches of the sleepers' hearts.  Peering over the side you could just
5830	see them (as before you heard them) wallowing in the sullen, black
5831	waters, and turning over on their backs as they scooped out huge
5832	globular pieces of the whale of the bigness of a human head.  This
5833	particular feat of the shark seems all but miraculous.  How at such
5834	an apparently unassailable surface, they contrive to gouge out such
5835	symmetrical mouthfuls, remains a part of the universal problem of all
5836	things.  The mark they thus leave on the whale, may best be likened
5837	to the hollow made by a carpenter in countersinking for a screw.
5838	
5839	Though amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a sea-fight,
5840	sharks will be seen longingly gazing up to the ship's decks, like
5841	hungry dogs round a table where red meat is being carved, ready to
5842	bolt down every killed man that is tossed to them; and though, while
5843	the valiant butchers over the deck-table are thus cannibally carving
5844	each other's live meat with carving-knives all gilded and tasselled,
5845	the sharks, also, with their jewel-hilted mouths, are quarrelsomely
5846	carving away under the table at the dead meat; and though, were you
5847	to turn the whole affair upside down, it would still be pretty much
5848	the same thing, that is to say, a shocking sharkish business enough
5849	for all parties; and though sharks also are the invariable outriders
5850	of all slave ships crossing the Atlantic, systematically trotting
5851	alongside, to be handy in case a parcel is to be carried anywhere, or
5852	a dead slave to be decently buried; and though one or two other like
5853	instances might be set down, touching the set terms, places, and
5854	occasions, when sharks do most socially congregate, and most
5855	hilariously feast; yet is there no conceivable time or occasion when
5856	you will find them in such countless numbers, and in gayer or more
5857	jovial spirits, than around a dead sperm whale, moored by night to a
5858	whaleship at sea.  If you have never seen that sight, then suspend
5859	your decision about the propriety of devil-worship, and the
5860	expediency of conciliating the devil.
5861	
5862	But, as yet, Stubb heeded not the mumblings of the banquet that was
5863	going on so nigh him, no more than the sharks heeded the smacking of
5864	his own epicurean lips.
5865	
5866	Cook, cook!--where's that old Fleece? he cried at length, widening
5867	his legs still further, as if to form a more secure base for his
5868	supper; and, at the same time darting his fork into the dish, as if
5869	stabbing with his lance; cook, you cook!--sail this way, cook!
5870	
5871	The old black, not in any very high glee at having been previously
5872	roused from his warm hammock at a most unseasonable hour, came
5873	shambling along from his galley, for, like many old blacks, there was
5874	something the matter with his knee-pans, which he did not keep well
5875	scoured like his other pans; this old Fleece, as they called him,
5876	came shuffling and limping along, assisting his step with his tongs,
5877	which, after a clumsy fashion, were made of straightened iron hoops;
5878	this old Ebony floundered along, and in obedience to the word of
5879	command, came to a dead stop on the opposite side of Stubb's
5880	sideboard; when, with both hands folded before him, and resting on
5881	his two-legged cane, he bowed his arched back still further over, at
5882	the same time sideways inclining his head, so as to bring his best
5883	ear into play.
5884	
5885	Cook, said Stubb, rapidly lifting a rather reddish morsel to his
5886	"mouth, don't you think this steak is rather overdone?  You've been
beating this steak too much, cook; it's too tender.  Don't I always
say that to be good, a whale-steak must be tough?  There are those
sharks now over the side, don't you see they prefer it tough and
rare?  What a shindy they are kicking up!  Cook, go and talk to 'em;
tell 'em they are welcome to help themselves civilly, and in
moderation, but they must keep quiet.  Blast me, if I can hear my own
voice.  Away, cook, and deliver my message.  Here, take this
lantern, snatching one from his sideboard; now then, go and preach
to 'em!"
5887	
5888	Sullenly taking the offered lantern, old Fleece limped across the
5889	deck to the bulwarks; and then, with one hand dropping his light low
5890	over the sea, so as to get a good view of his congregation, with the
5891	other hand he solemnly flourished his tongs, and leaning far over the
5892	side in a mumbling voice began addressing the sharks, while Stubb,
5893	softly crawling behind, overheard all that was said.
5894	
5895	"Fellow-critters: I'se ordered here to say dat you must stop dat dam
noise dare.  You hear?  Stop dat dam smackin' ob de lips!  Massa
Stubb say dat you can fill your dam bellies up to de hatchings, but
by Gor! you must stop dat dam racket!"
5896	
5897	Cook, here interposed Stubb, accompanying the word with a sudden
5898	"slap on the shoulder,--Cook! why, damn your eyes, you mustn't swear
that way when you're preaching.  That's no way to convert sinners,
cook!"
5899	
5900	Who dat?  Den preach to him yourself, sullenly turning to go.
5901	
5902	No, cook; go on, go on.
5903	
5904	Well, den, Belubed fellow-critters:-
5905	
5906	Right! exclaimed Stubb, approvingly, coax 'em to it; try that,
5907	and Fleece continued.
5908	
5909	"Do you is all sharks, and by natur wery woracious, yet I zay to you,
fellow-critters, dat dat woraciousness--'top dat dam slappin' ob de
tail!  How you tink to hear, spose you keep up such a dam slappin'
and bitin' dare?"
5910	
5911	"Cook, cried Stubb, collaring him, I won't have that swearing.
Talk to 'em gentlemanly."
5912	
5913	Once more the sermon proceeded.
5914	
5915	"Your woraciousness, fellow-critters, I don't blame ye so much for;
dat is natur, and can't be helped; but to gobern dat wicked natur,
dat is de pint.  You is sharks, sartin; but if you gobern de shark in
you, why den you be angel; for all angel is not'ing more dan de shark
well goberned.  Now, look here, bred'ren, just try wonst to be cibil,
a helping yourselbs from dat whale.  Don't be tearin' de blubber out
your neighbour's mout, I say.  Is not one shark dood right as toder
to dat whale?  And, by Gor, none on you has de right to dat whale;
dat whale belong to some one else.  I know some o' you has berry brig
mout, brigger dan oders; but den de brig mouts sometimes has de
small bellies; so dat de brigness of de mout is not to swaller wid,
but to bit off de blubber for de small fry ob sharks, dat can't get
into de scrouge to help demselves."
5916	
5917	Well done, old Fleece! cried Stubb, that's Christianity; go on.
5918	
5919	"No use goin' on; de dam willains will keep a scougin' and slappin'
each oder, Massa Stubb; dey don't hear one word; no use a-preaching
to such dam g'uttons as you call 'em, till dare bellies is full, and
dare bellies is bottomless; and when dey do get 'em full, dey wont
hear you den; for den dey sink in the sea, go fast to sleep on de
coral, and can't hear noting at all, no more, for eber and eber."
5920	
5921	"Upon my soul, I am about of the same opinion; so give the
benediction, Fleece, and I'll away to my supper."
5922	
5923	Upon this, Fleece, holding both hands over the fishy mob, raised his
5924	shrill voice, and cried--
5925	
5926	"Cussed fellow-critters!  Kick up de damndest row as ever you can;
fill your dam bellies 'till dey bust--and den die."
5927	
5928	"Now, cook, said Stubb, resuming his supper at the capstan; stand
just where you stood before, there, over against me, and pay
particular attention."
5929	
5930	All 'dention, said Fleece, again stooping over upon his tongs in
5931	the desired position.
5932	
5933	"Well, said Stubb, helping himself freely meanwhile; I shall now go
back to the subject of this steak.  In the first place, how old are
you, cook?"
5934	
5935	What dat do wid de 'teak, said the old black, testily.
5936	
5937	Silence!  How old are you, cook?
5938	
5939	'Bout ninety, dey say, he gloomily muttered.
5940	
5941	"And you have lived in this world hard upon one hundred years, cook,
and don't know yet how to cook a whale-steak? rapidly bolting"
5942	another mouthful at the last word, so that morsel seemed a
5943	continuation of the question.  Where were you born, cook?
5944	
5945	'Hind de hatchway, in ferry-boat, goin' ober de Roanoke.
5946	
5947	"Born in a ferry-boat!  That's queer, too.  But I want to know what
country you were born in, cook!"
5948	
5949	Didn't I say de Roanoke country? he cried sharply.
5950	
5951	"No, you didn't, cook; but I'll tell you what I'm coming to, cook.
You must go home and be born over again; you don't know how to cook a
whale-steak yet."
5952	
5953	Bress my soul, if I cook noder one, he growled, angrily, turning
5954	round to depart.
5955	
5956	"Come back here, cook;--here, hand me those tongs;--now take that bit
of steak there, and tell me if you think that steak cooked as it
should be?  Take it, I say--holding the tongs towards him--take it,
and taste it."
5957	
5958	Faintly smacking his withered lips over it for a moment, the old
5959	negro muttered, Best cooked 'teak I eber taste; joosy, berry joosy.
5960	
5961	"Cook, said Stubb, squaring himself once more; do you belong to the
church?"
5962	
5963	Passed one once in Cape-Down, said the old man sullenly.
5964	
5965	"And you have once in your life passed a holy church in Cape-Town,
where you doubtless overheard a holy parson addressing his hearers as
his beloved fellow-creatures, have you, cook!  And yet you come here,
and tell me such a dreadful lie as you did just now, eh? said Stubb."
5966	Where do you expect to go to, cook?
5967	
5968	Go to bed berry soon, he mumbled, half-turning as he spoke.
5969	
5970	"Avast! heave to!  I mean when you die, cook.  It's an awful
question.  Now what's your answer?"
5971	
5972	When dis old brack man dies, said the negro slowly, changing his
5973	"whole air and demeanor, he hisself won't go nowhere; but some
bressed angel will come and fetch him."
5974	
5975	"Fetch him?  How?  In a coach and four, as they fetched Elijah?  And
fetch him where?"
5976	
5977	Up dere, said Fleece, holding his tongs straight over his head, and
5978	keeping it there very solemnly.
5979	
5980	"So, then, you expect to go up into our main-top, do you, cook, when
you are dead?  But don't you know the higher you climb, the colder it
gets?  Main-top, eh?"
5981	
5982	Didn't say dat t'all, said Fleece, again in the sulks.
5983	
5984	"You said up there, didn't you? and now look yourself, and see where
your tongs are pointing.  But, perhaps you expect to get into heaven
by crawling through the lubber's hole, cook; but, no, no, cook, you
don't get there, except you go the regular way, round by the rigging.
It's a ticklish business, but must be done, or else it's no go.  But
none of us are in heaven yet.  Drop your tongs, cook, and hear my
orders.  Do ye hear?  Hold your hat in one hand, and clap t'other
a'top of your heart, when I'm giving my orders, cook.  What! that
your heart, there?--that's your gizzard!  Aloft! aloft!--that's
it--now you have it.  Hold it there now, and pay attention."
5985	
5986	All 'dention, said the old black, with both hands placed as
5987	desired, vainly wriggling his grizzled head, as if to get both ears
5988	in front at one and the same time.
5989	
5990	"Well then, cook, you see this whale-steak of yours was so very bad,
that I have put it out of sight as soon as possible; you see that,
don't you?  Well, for the future, when you cook another whale-steak
for my private table here, the capstan, I'll tell you what to do so
as not to spoil it by overdoing.  Hold the steak in one hand, and
show a live coal to it with the other; that done, dish it; d'ye hear?
And now to-morrow, cook, when we are cutting in the fish, be sure
you stand by to get the tips of his fins; have them put in pickle.
As for the ends of the flukes, have them soused, cook.  There, now ye
may go."
5991	
5992	But Fleece had hardly got three paces off, when he was recalled.
5993	
5994	"Cook, give me cutlets for supper to-morrow night in the mid-watch.
D'ye hear? away you sail, then.--Halloa! stop! make a bow before you
go.--Avast heaving again!  Whale-balls for breakfast--don't forget."
5995	
5996	"Wish, by gor! whale eat him, 'stead of him eat whale.  I'm bressed
if he ain't more of shark dan Massa Shark hisself, muttered the old"
5997	man, limping away; with which sage ejaculation he went to his
5998	hammock.

6002	CHAPTER 65
6003	
6004	The Whale as a Dish.
6005	
6006	
6007	That mortal man should feed upon the creature that feeds his lamp,
6008	and, like Stubb, eat him by his own light, as you may say; this seems
6009	so outlandish a thing that one must needs go a little into the
6010	history and philosophy of it.
6011	
6012	It is upon record, that three centuries ago the tongue of the Right
6013	Whale was esteemed a great delicacy in France, and commanded large
6014	prices there.  Also, that in Henry VIIIth's time, a certain cook of
6015	the court obtained a handsome reward for inventing an admirable sauce
6016	to be eaten with barbacued porpoises, which, you remember, are a
6017	species of whale.  Porpoises, indeed, are to this day considered fine
6018	eating.  The meat is made into balls about the size of billiard
6019	balls, and being well seasoned and spiced might be taken for
6020	turtle-balls or veal balls.  The old monks of Dunfermline were very
6021	fond of them.  They had a great porpoise grant from the crown.
6022	
6023	The fact is, that among his hunters at least, the whale would by all
6024	hands be considered a noble dish, were there not so much of him; but
6025	when you come to sit down before a meat-pie nearly one hundred feet
6026	long, it takes away your appetite.  Only the most unprejudiced of men
6027	like Stubb, nowadays partake of cooked whales; but the Esquimaux are
6028	not so fastidious.  We all know how they live upon whales, and have
6029	rare old vintages of prime old train oil.  Zogranda, one of their
6030	most famous doctors, recommends strips of blubber for infants, as
6031	being exceedingly juicy and nourishing.  And this reminds me that
6032	certain Englishmen, who long ago were accidentally left in Greenland
6033	by a whaling vessel--that these men actually lived for several months
6034	on the mouldy scraps of whales which had been left ashore after
6035	trying out the blubber.  Among the Dutch whalemen these scraps are
6036	called fritters; which, indeed, they greatly resemble, being brown
6037	and crisp, and smelling something like old Amsterdam housewives'
6038	dough-nuts or oly-cooks, when fresh.  They have such an eatable look
6039	that the most self-denying stranger can hardly keep his hands off.
6040	
6041	But what further depreciates the whale as a civilized dish, is his
6042	exceeding richness.  He is the great prize ox of the sea, too fat to
6043	be delicately good.  Look at his hump, which would be as fine eating
6044	as the buffalo's (which is esteemed a rare dish), were it not such a
6045	solid pyramid of fat.  But the spermaceti itself, how bland and
6046	creamy that is; like the transparent, half-jellied, white meat of a
6047	cocoanut in the third month of its growth, yet far too rich to supply
6048	a substitute for butter.  Nevertheless, many whalemen have a method
6049	of absorbing it into some other substance, and then partaking of it.
6050	In the long try watches of the night it is a common thing for the
6051	seamen to dip their ship-biscuit into the huge oil-pots and let them
6052	fry there awhile.  Many a good supper have I thus made.
6053	
6054	In the case of a small Sperm Whale the brains are accounted a fine
6055	dish.  The casket of the skull is broken into with an axe, and the
6056	two plump, whitish lobes being withdrawn (precisely resembling two
6057	large puddings), they are then mixed with flour, and cooked into a
6058	most delectable mess, in flavor somewhat resembling calves' head,
6059	which is quite a dish among some epicures; and every one knows that
6060	some young bucks among the epicures, by continually dining upon
6061	calves' brains, by and by get to have a little brains of their own,
6062	so as to be able to tell a calf's head from their own heads; which,
6063	indeed, requires uncommon discrimination.  And that is the reason why
6064	a young buck with an intelligent looking calf's head before him, is
6065	somehow one of the saddest sights you can see.  The head looks a sort
6066	of reproachfully at him, with an Et tu Brute! expression.
6067	
6068	It is not, perhaps, entirely because the whale is so excessively
6069	unctuous that landsmen seem to regard the eating of him with
6070	abhorrence; that appears to result, in some way, from the
6071	consideration before mentioned: i.e. that a man should eat a newly
6072	murdered thing of the sea, and eat it too by its own light.  But no
6073	doubt the first man that ever murdered an ox was regarded as a
6074	murderer; perhaps he was hung; and if he had been put on his trial by
6075	oxen, he certainly would have been; and he certainly deserved it if
6076	any murderer does.  Go to the meat-market of a Saturday night and see
6077	the crowds of live bipeds staring up at the long rows of dead
6078	quadrupeds.  Does not that sight take a tooth out of the cannibal's
6079	jaw?  Cannibals? who is not a cannibal?  I tell you it will be more
6080	tolerable for the Fejee that salted down a lean missionary in his
6081	cellar against a coming famine; it will be more tolerable for that
6082	provident Fejee, I say, in the day of judgment, than for thee,
6083	civilized and enlightened gourmand, who nailest geese to the ground
6084	and feastest on their bloated livers in thy pate-de-foie-gras.
6085	
6086	But Stubb, he eats the whale by its own light, does he? and that is
6087	adding insult to injury, is it?  Look at your knife-handle, there, my
6088	civilized and enlightened gourmand dining off that roast beef, what
6089	is that handle made of?--what but the bones of the brother of the
6090	very ox you are eating?  And what do you pick your teeth with, after
6091	devouring that fat goose?  With a feather of the same fowl.  And with
6092	what quill did the Secretary of the Society for the Suppression of
6093	Cruelty to Ganders formally indite his circulars?  It is only within
6094	the last month or two that that society passed a resolution to
6095	patronise nothing but steel pens.

6101	The Shark Massacre.
6102	
6103	
6104	When in the Southern Fishery, a captured Sperm Whale, after long and
6105	weary toil, is brought alongside late at night, it is not, as a
6106	general thing at least, customary to proceed at once to the business
6107	of cutting him in.  For that business is an exceedingly laborious
6108	one; is not very soon completed; and requires all hands to set about
6109	it.  Therefore, the common usage is to take in all sail; lash the
6110	helm a'lee; and then send every one below to his hammock till
6111	daylight, with the reservation that, until that time, anchor-watches
6112	shall be kept; that is, two and two for an hour, each couple, the
6113	crew in rotation shall mount the deck to see that all goes well.
6114	
6115	But sometimes, especially upon the Line in the Pacific, this plan
6116	will not answer at all; because such incalculable hosts of sharks
6117	gather round the moored carcase, that were he left so for six hours,
6118	say, on a stretch, little more than the skeleton would be visible by
6119	morning.  In most other parts of the ocean, however, where these fish
6120	do not so largely abound, their wondrous voracity can be at times
6121	considerably diminished, by vigorously stirring them up with sharp
6122	whaling-spades, a procedure notwithstanding, which, in some
6123	instances, only seems to tickle them into still greater activity.
6124	But it was not thus in the present case with the Pequod's sharks;
6125	though, to be sure, any man unaccustomed to such sights, to have
6126	looked over her side that night, would have almost thought the whole
6127	round sea was one huge cheese, and those sharks the maggots in it.
6128	
6129	Nevertheless, upon Stubb setting the anchor-watch after his supper
6130	was concluded; and when, accordingly, Queequeg and a forecastle
6131	seaman came on deck, no small excitement was created among the
6132	sharks; for immediately suspending the cutting stages over the side,
6133	and lowering three lanterns, so that they cast long gleams of light
6134	over the turbid sea, these two mariners, darting their long
6135	whaling-spades, kept up an incessant murdering of the sharks,* by
6136	striking the keen steel deep into their skulls, seemingly their only
6137	vital part.  But in the foamy confusion of their mixed and struggling
6138	hosts, the marksmen could not always hit their mark; and this brought
6139	about new revelations of the incredible ferocity of the foe.  They
6140	viciously snapped, not only at each other's disembowelments, but like
6141	flexible bows, bent round, and bit their own; till those entrails
6142	seemed swallowed over and over again by the same mouth, to be
6143	oppositely voided by the gaping wound.  Nor was this all.  It was
6144	unsafe to meddle with the corpses and ghosts of these creatures.  A
6145	sort of generic or Pantheistic vitality seemed to lurk in their very
6146	joints and bones, after what might be called the individual life had
6147	departed.  Killed and hoisted on deck for the sake of his skin, one
6148	of these sharks almost took poor Queequeg's hand off, when he tried
6149	to shut down the dead lid of his murderous jaw.
6150	
6151	
6152	*The whaling-spade used for cutting-in is made of the very best
6153	steel; is about the bigness of a man's spread hand; and in general
6154	shape, corresponds to the garden implement after which it is named;
6155	only its sides are perfectly flat, and its upper end considerably
6156	narrower than the lower.  This weapon is always kept as sharp as
6157	possible; and when being used is occasionally honed, just like a
6158	razor.  In its socket, a stiff pole, from twenty to thirty feet long,
6159	is inserted for a handle.
6160	
6161	
6162	Queequeg no care what god made him shark, said the savage,
6163	"agonizingly lifting his hand up and down; wedder Fejee god or
Nantucket god; but de god wat made shark must be one dam Ingin."

6169	Cutting In.
6170	
6171	
6172	It was a Saturday night, and such a Sabbath as followed!  Ex officio
6173	professors of Sabbath breaking are all whalemen.  The ivory Pequod
6174	was turned into what seemed a shamble; every sailor a butcher.  You
6175	would have thought we were offering up ten thousand red oxen to the
6176	sea gods.
6177	
6178	In the first place, the enormous cutting tackles, among other
6179	ponderous things comprising a cluster of blocks generally painted
6180	green, and which no single man can possibly lift--this vast bunch of
6181	grapes was swayed up to the main-top and firmly lashed to the lower
6182	mast-head, the strongest point anywhere above a ship's deck.  The end
6183	of the hawser-like rope winding through these intricacies, was then
6184	conducted to the windlass, and the huge lower block of the tackles
6185	was swung over the whale; to this block the great blubber hook,
6186	weighing some one hundred pounds, was attached.  And now suspended in
6187	stages over the side, Starbuck and Stubb, the mates, armed with their
6188	long spades, began cutting a hole in the body for the insertion of
6189	the hook just above the nearest of the two side-fins.  This done, a
6190	broad, semicircular line is cut round the hole, the hook is inserted,
6191	and the main body of the crew striking up a wild chorus, now commence
6192	heaving in one dense crowd at the windlass.  When instantly, the
6193	entire ship careens over on her side; every bolt in her starts like
6194	the nail-heads of an old house in frosty weather; she trembles,
6195	quivers, and nods her frighted mast-heads to the sky.  More and more
6196	she leans over to the whale, while every gasping heave of the
6197	windlass is answered by a helping heave from the billows; till at
6198	last, a swift, startling snap is heard; with a great swash the ship
6199	rolls upwards and backwards from the whale, and the triumphant tackle
6200	rises into sight dragging after it the disengaged semicircular end of
6201	the first strip of blubber.  Now as the blubber envelopes the whale
6202	precisely as the rind does an orange, so is it stripped off from the
6203	body precisely as an orange is sometimes stripped by spiralizing it.
6204	For the strain constantly kept up by the windlass continually keeps
6205	the whale rolling over and over in the water, and as the blubber in
6206	one strip uniformly peels off along the line called the scarf,
6207	simultaneously cut by the spades of Starbuck and Stubb, the mates;
6208	and just as fast as it is thus peeled off, and indeed by that very
6209	act itself, it is all the time being hoisted higher and higher aloft
6210	till its upper end grazes the main-top; the men at the windlass then
6211	cease heaving, and for a moment or two the prodigious blood-dripping
6212	mass sways to and fro as if let down from the sky, and every one
6213	present must take good heed to dodge it when it swings, else it may
6214	box his ears and pitch him headlong overboard.
6215	
6216	One of the attending harpooneers now advances with a long, keen
6217	weapon called a boarding-sword, and watching his chance he
6218	dexterously slices out a considerable hole in the lower part of the
6219	swaying mass.  Into this hole, the end of the second alternating
6220	great tackle is then hooked so as to retain a hold upon the blubber,
6221	in order to prepare for what follows.  Whereupon, this accomplished
6222	swordsman, warning all hands to stand off, once more makes a
6223	scientific dash at the mass, and with a few sidelong, desperate,
6224	lunging slicings, severs it completely in twain; so that while the
6225	short lower part is still fast, the long upper strip, called a
6226	blanket-piece, swings clear, and is all ready for lowering.  The
6227	heavers forward now resume their song, and while the one tackle is
6228	peeling and hoisting a second strip from the whale, the other is
6229	slowly slackened away, and down goes the first strip through the main
6230	hatchway right beneath, into an unfurnished parlor called the
6231	blubber-room.  Into this twilight apartment sundry nimble hands keep
6232	coiling away the long blanket-piece as if it were a great live mass
6233	of plaited serpents.  And thus the work proceeds; the two tackles
6234	hoisting and lowering simultaneously; both whale and windlass
6235	heaving, the heavers singing, the blubber-room gentlemen coiling, the
6236	mates scarfing, the ship straining, and all hands swearing
6237	occasionally, by way of assuaging the general friction.

6240	
6241	CHAPTER 68
6242	
6243	The Blanket.
6244	
6245	
6246	I have given no small attention to that not unvexed subject, the skin
6247	of the whale.  I have had controversies about it with experienced
6248	whalemen afloat, and learned naturalists ashore.  My original opinion
6249	remains unchanged; but it is only an opinion.
6250	
6251	The question is, what and where is the skin of the whale?  Already
6252	you know what his blubber is.  That blubber is something of the
6253	consistence of firm, close-grained beef, but tougher, more elastic
6254	and compact, and ranges from eight or ten to twelve and fifteen
6255	inches in thickness.
6256	
6257	Now, however preposterous it may at first seem to talk of any
6258	creature's skin as being of that sort of consistence and thickness,
6259	yet in point of fact these are no arguments against such a
6260	presumption; because you cannot raise any other dense enveloping
6261	layer from the whale's body but that same blubber; and the outermost
6262	enveloping layer of any animal, if reasonably dense, what can that be
6263	but the skin?  True, from the unmarred dead body of the whale, you
6264	may scrape off with your hand an infinitely thin, transparent
6265	substance, somewhat resembling the thinnest shreds of isinglass, only
6266	it is almost as flexible and soft as satin; that is, previous to
6267	being dried, when it not only contracts and thickens, but becomes
6268	rather hard and brittle.  I have several such dried bits, which I use
6269	for marks in my whale-books.  It is transparent, as I said before;
6270	and being laid upon the printed page, I have sometimes pleased myself
6271	with fancying it exerted a magnifying influence.  At any rate, it is
6272	pleasant to read about whales through their own spectacles, as you
6273	may say.  But what I am driving at here is this.  That same
6274	infinitely thin, isinglass substance, which, I admit, invests the
6275	entire body of the whale, is not so much to be regarded as the skin
6276	of the creature, as the skin of the skin, so to speak; for it were
6277	simply ridiculous to say, that the proper skin of the tremendous
6278	whale is thinner and more tender than the skin of a new-born child.
6279	But no more of this.
6280	
6281	Assuming the blubber to be the skin of the whale; then, when this
6282	skin, as in the case of a very large Sperm Whale, will yield the bulk
6283	of one hundred barrels of oil; and, when it is considered that, in
6284	quantity, or rather weight, that oil, in its expressed state, is only
6285	three fourths, and not the entire substance of the coat; some idea
6286	may hence be had of the enormousness of that animated mass, a mere
6287	part of whose mere integument yields such a lake of liquid as that.
6288	Reckoning ten barrels to the ton, you have ten tons for the net
6289	weight of only three quarters of the stuff of the whale's skin.
6290	
6291	In life, the visible surface of the Sperm Whale is not the least
6292	among the many marvels he presents.  Almost invariably it is all over
6293	obliquely crossed and re-crossed with numberless straight marks in
6294	thick array, something like those in the finest Italian line
6295	engravings.  But these marks do not seem to be impressed upon the
6296	isinglass substance above mentioned, but seem to be seen through it,
6297	as if they were engraved upon the body itself.  Nor is this all.  In
6298	some instances, to the quick, observant eye, those linear marks, as
6299	in a veritable engraving, but afford the ground for far other
6300	delineations.  These are hieroglyphical; that is, if you call those
6301	mysterious cyphers on the walls of pyramids hieroglyphics, then that
6302	is the proper word to use in the present connexion.  By my retentive
6303	memory of the hieroglyphics upon one Sperm Whale in particular, I was
6304	much struck with a plate representing the old Indian characters
6305	chiselled on the famous hieroglyphic palisades on the banks of the
6306	Upper Mississippi.  Like those mystic rocks, too, the mystic-marked
6307	whale remains undecipherable.  This allusion to the Indian rocks
6308	reminds me of another thing.  Besides all the other phenomena which
6309	the exterior of the Sperm Whale presents, he not seldom displays the
6310	back, and more especially his flanks, effaced in great part of the
6311	regular linear appearance, by reason of numerous rude scratches,
6312	altogether of an irregular, random aspect.  I should say that those
6313	New England rocks on the sea-coast, which Agassiz imagines to bear
6314	the marks of violent scraping contact with vast floating icebergs--I
6315	should say, that those rocks must not a little resemble the Sperm
6316	Whale in this particular.  It also seems to me that such scratches in
6317	the whale are probably made by hostile contact with other whales; for
6318	I have most remarked them in the large, full-grown bulls of the
6319	species.
6320	
6321	A word or two more concerning this matter of the skin or blubber of
6322	the whale.  It has already been said, that it is stript from him in
6323	long pieces, called blanket-pieces.  Like most sea-terms, this one is
6324	very happy and significant.  For the whale is indeed wrapt up in his
6325	blubber as in a real blanket or counterpane; or, still better, an
6326	Indian poncho slipt over his head, and skirting his extremity.  It is
6327	by reason of this cosy blanketing of his body, that the whale is
6328	enabled to keep himself comfortable in all weathers, in all seas,
6329	times, and tides.  What would become of a Greenland whale, say, in
6330	those shuddering, icy seas of the North, if unsupplied with his cosy
6331	surtout?  True, other fish are found exceedingly brisk in those
6332	Hyperborean waters; but these, be it observed, are your cold-blooded,
6333	lungless fish, whose very bellies are refrigerators; creatures, that
6334	warm themselves under the lee of an iceberg, as a traveller in winter
6335	would bask before an inn fire; whereas, like man, the whale has lungs
6336	and warm blood.  Freeze his blood, and he dies.  How wonderful is it
6337	then--except after explanation--that this great monster, to whom
6338	corporeal warmth is as indispensable as it is to man; how wonderful
6339	that he should be found at home, immersed to his lips for life in
6340	those Arctic waters! where, when seamen fall overboard, they are
6341	sometimes found, months afterwards, perpendicularly frozen into the
6342	hearts of fields of ice, as a fly is found glued in amber.  But more
6343	surprising is it to know, as has been proved by experiment, that the
6344	blood of a Polar whale is warmer than that of a Borneo negro in
6345	summer.
6346	
6347	It does seem to me, that herein we see the rare virtue of a strong
6348	individual vitality, and the rare virtue of thick walls, and the rare
6349	virtue of interior spaciousness.  Oh, man! admire and model thyself
6350	after the whale!  Do thou, too, remain warm among ice.  Do thou, too,
6351	live in this world without being of it.  Be cool at the equator; keep
6352	thy blood fluid at the Pole.  Like the great dome of St. Peter's, and
6353	like the great whale, retain, O man! in all seasons a temperature of
6354	thine own.
6355	
6356	But how easy and how hopeless to teach these fine things!  Of
6357	erections, how few are domed like St. Peter's! of creatures, how few
6358	vast as the whale!

6367	Haul in the chains!  Let the carcase go astern!
6368	
6369	The vast tackles have now done their duty.  The peeled white body of
6370	the beheaded whale flashes like a marble sepulchre; though changed in
6371	hue, it has not perceptibly lost anything in bulk.  It is still
6372	colossal.  Slowly it floats more and more away, the water round it
6373	torn and splashed by the insatiate sharks, and the air above vexed
6374	with rapacious flights of screaming fowls, whose beaks are like so
6375	many insulting poniards in the whale.  The vast white headless
6376	phantom floats further and further from the ship, and every rod that
6377	it so floats, what seem square roods of sharks and cubic roods of
6378	fowls, augment the murderous din.  For hours and hours from the
6379	almost stationary ship that hideous sight is seen.  Beneath the
6380	unclouded and mild azure sky, upon the fair face of the pleasant sea,
6381	wafted by the joyous breezes, that great mass of death floats on and
6382	on, till lost in infinite perspectives.
6383	
6384	There's a most doleful and most mocking funeral!  The sea-vultures
6385	all in pious mourning, the air-sharks all punctiliously in black or
6386	speckled.  In life but few of them would have helped the whale, I
6387	ween, if peradventure he had needed it; but upon the banquet of his
6388	funeral they most piously do pounce.  Oh, horrible vultureism of
6389	earth! from which not the mightiest whale is free.
6390	
6391	Nor is this the end.  Desecrated as the body is, a vengeful ghost
6392	survives and hovers over it to scare.  Espied by some timid
6393	man-of-war or blundering discovery-vessel from afar, when the
6394	distance obscuring the swarming fowls, nevertheless still shows the
6395	white mass floating in the sun, and the white spray heaving high
6396	against it; straightway the whale's unharming corpse, with trembling
6397	fingers is set down in the log--SHOALS, ROCKS, AND BREAKERS
6398	HEREABOUTS: BEWARE!  And for years afterwards, perhaps, ships shun
6399	the place; leaping over it as silly sheep leap over a vacuum, because
6400	their leader originally leaped there when a stick was held.  There's
6401	your law of precedents; there's your utility of traditions; there's
6402	the story of your obstinate survival of old beliefs never bottomed on
6403	the earth, and now not even hovering in the air!  There's orthodoxy!
6404	
6405	Thus, while in life the great whale's body may have been a real
6406	terror to his foes, in his death his ghost becomes a powerless panic
6407	to a world.
6408	
6409	Are you a believer in ghosts, my friend?  There are other ghosts than
6410	the Cock-Lane one, and far deeper men than Doctor Johnson who believe
6411	in them.

6420	It should not have been omitted that previous to completely stripping
6421	the body of the leviathan, he was beheaded.  Now, the beheading of
6422	the Sperm Whale is a scientific anatomical feat, upon which
6423	experienced whale surgeons very much pride themselves: and not
6424	without reason.
6425	
6426	Consider that the whale has nothing that can properly be called a
6427	neck; on the contrary, where his head and body seem to join, there,
6428	in that very place, is the thickest part of him.  Remember, also,
6429	that the surgeon must operate from above, some eight or ten feet
6430	intervening between him and his subject, and that subject almost
6431	hidden in a discoloured, rolling, and oftentimes tumultuous and
6432	bursting sea.  Bear in mind, too, that under these untoward
6433	circumstances he has to cut many feet deep in the flesh; and in that
6434	subterraneous manner, without so much as getting one single peep into
6435	the ever-contracting gash thus made, he must skilfully steer clear
6436	of all adjacent, interdicted parts, and exactly divide the spine at a
6437	critical point hard by its insertion into the skull.  Do you not
6438	marvel, then, at Stubb's boast, that he demanded but ten minutes to
6439	behead a sperm whale?
6440	
6441	When first severed, the head is dropped astern and held there by a
6442	cable till the body is stripped.  That done, if it belong to a small
6443	whale it is hoisted on deck to be deliberately disposed of.  But,
6444	with a full grown leviathan this is impossible; for the sperm whale's
6445	head embraces nearly one third of his entire bulk, and completely to
6446	suspend such a burden as that, even by the immense tackles of a
6447	whaler, this were as vain a thing as to attempt weighing a Dutch barn
6448	in jewellers' scales.
6449	
6450	The Pequod's whale being decapitated and the body stripped, the head
6451	was hoisted against the ship's side--about half way out of the sea,
6452	so that it might yet in great part be buoyed up by its native
6453	element.  And there with the strained craft steeply leaning over to it,
6454	by reason of the enormous downward drag from the lower mast-head, and
6455	every yard-arm on that side projecting like a crane over the waves;
6456	there, that blood-dripping head hung to the Pequod's waist like the
6457	giant Holofernes's from the girdle of Judith.
6458	
6459	When this last task was accomplished it was noon, and the seamen went
6460	below to their dinner.  Silence reigned over the before tumultuous
6461	but now deserted deck.  An intense copper calm, like a universal
6462	yellow lotus, was more and more unfolding its noiseless measureless
6463	leaves upon the sea.
6464	
6465	A short space elapsed, and up into this noiselessness came Ahab alone
6466	from his cabin.  Taking a few turns on the quarter-deck, he paused to
6467	gaze over the side, then slowly getting into the main-chains he took
6468	Stubb's long spade--still remaining there after the whale's
6469	Decapitation--and striking it into the lower part of the
6470	half-suspended mass, placed its other end crutch-wise under one arm,
6471	and so stood leaning over with eyes attentively fixed on this head.
6472	
6473	It was a black and hooded head; and hanging there in the midst of so
6474	"intense a calm, it seemed the Sphynx's in the desert.  Speak, thou
vast and venerable head, muttered Ahab, which, though ungarnished
with a beard, yet here and there lookest hoary with mosses; speak,
mighty head, and tell us the secret thing that is in thee.  Of all
divers, thou hast dived the deepest.  That head upon which the upper
sun now gleams, has moved amid this world's foundations.  Where
unrecorded names and navies rust, and untold hopes and anchors rot;
where in her murderous hold this frigate earth is ballasted with
bones of millions of the drowned; there, in that awful water-land,
there was thy most familiar home.  Thou hast been where bell or diver
never went; hast slept by many a sailor's side, where sleepless
mothers would give their lives to lay them down.  Thou saw'st the
locked lovers when leaping from their flaming ship; heart to heart
they sank beneath the exulting wave; true to each other, when heaven
seemed false to them.  Thou saw'st the murdered mate when tossed by
pirates from the midnight deck; for hours he fell into the deeper
midnight of the insatiate maw; and his murderers still sailed on
unharmed--while swift lightnings shivered the neighboring ship that
would have borne a righteous husband to outstretched, longing arms.
O head! thou hast seen enough to split the planets and make an
infidel of Abraham, and not one syllable is thine!"
6475	
6476	Sail ho! cried a triumphant voice from the main-mast-head.
6477	
6478	Aye?  Well, now, that's cheering, cried Ahab, suddenly erecting
6479	"himself, while whole thunder-clouds swept aside from his brow.  That
lively cry upon this deadly calm might almost convert a better
man.--Where away?"
6480	
6481	"Three points on the starboard bow, sir, and bringing down her breeze
to us!

Better and better, man.  Would now St. Paul would come along that"
6482	way, and to my breezelessness bring his breeze!  O Nature, and O soul
6483	of man! how far beyond all utterance are your linked analogies! not
6484	the smallest atom stirs or lives on matter, but has its cunning
6485	"duplicate in mind.



CHAPTER 71

The Jeroboam's Story.


Hand in hand, ship and breeze blew on; but the breeze came faster
than the ship, and soon the Pequod began to rock.

By and by, through the glass the stranger's boats and manned
mast-heads proved her a whale-ship.  But as she was so far to
windward, and shooting by, apparently making a passage to some other
ground, the Pequod could not hope to reach her.  So the signal was
set to see what response would be made.

Here be it said, that like the vessels of military marines, the ships
of the American Whale Fleet have each a private signal; all which
signals being collected in a book with the names of the respective
vessels attached, every captain is provided with it.  Thereby, the
whale commanders are enabled to recognise each other upon the ocean,
even at considerable distances and with no small facility.

The Pequod's signal was at last responded to by the stranger's
setting her own; which proved the ship to be the Jeroboam of
Nantucket.  Squaring her yards, she bore down, ranged abeam under the
Pequod's lee, and lowered a boat; it soon drew nigh; but, as the
side-ladder was being rigged by Starbuck's order to accommodate the
visiting captain, the stranger in question waved his hand from his
boat's stern in token of that proceeding being entirely unnecessary.
It turned out that the Jeroboam had a malignant epidemic on board,
and that Mayhew, her captain, was fearful of infecting the Pequod's
company.  For, though himself and boat's crew remained untainted, and
though his ship was half a rifle-shot off, and an incorruptible sea
and air rolling and flowing between; yet conscientiously adhering to
the timid quarantine of the land, he peremptorily refused to come
into direct contact with the Pequod.

But this did by no means prevent all communications.  Preserving an
interval of some few yards between itself and the ship, the
Jeroboam's boat by the occasional use of its oars contrived to keep
parallel to the Pequod, as she heavily forged through the sea (for by
this time it blew very fresh), with her main-topsail aback; though,
indeed, at times by the sudden onset of a large rolling wave, the
boat would be pushed some way ahead; but would be soon skilfully
brought to her proper bearings again.  Subject to this, and other the
like interruptions now and then, a conversation was sustained between
the two parties; but at intervals not without still another
interruption of a very different sort.

Pulling an oar in the Jeroboam's boat, was a man of a singular
appearance, even in that wild whaling life where individual
notabilities make up all totalities.  He was a small, short, youngish
man, sprinkled all over his face with freckles, and wearing redundant
yellow hair.  A long-skirted, cabalistically-cut coat of a faded
walnut tinge enveloped him; the overlapping sleeves of which were
rolled up on his wrists.  A deep, settled, fanatic delirium was in
his eyes.

So soon as this figure had been first descried, Stubb had
exclaimed--That's he! that's he!--the long-togged scaramouch the"
6486	"Town-Ho's company told us of!  Stubb here alluded to a strange story
told of the Jeroboam, and a certain man among her crew, some time
previous when the Pequod spoke the Town-Ho.  According to this
account and what was subsequently learned, it seemed that the
scaramouch in question had gained a wonderful ascendency over almost
everybody in the Jeroboam.  His story was this:

He had been originally nurtured among the crazy society of Neskyeuna
Shakers, where he had been a great prophet; in their cracked, secret
meetings having several times descended from heaven by the way of a
trap-door, announcing the speedy opening of the seventh vial, which
he carried in his vest-pocket; but, which, instead of containing
gunpowder, was supposed to be charged with laudanum.  A strange,
apostolic whim having seized him, he had left Neskyeuna for
Nantucket, where, with that cunning peculiar to craziness, he assumed
a steady, common-sense exterior, and offered himself as a green-hand
candidate for the Jeroboam's whaling voyage.  They engaged him; but
straightway upon the ship's getting out of sight of land, his
insanity broke out in a freshet.  He announced himself as the
archangel Gabriel, and commanded the captain to jump overboard.  He
published his manifesto, whereby he set himself forth as the
deliverer of the isles of the sea and vicar-general of all Oceanica.
The unflinching earnestness with which he declared these things;--the
dark, daring play of his sleepless, excited imagination, and all the
preternatural terrors of real delirium, united to invest this Gabriel
in the minds of the majority of the ignorant crew, with an atmosphere
of sacredness.  Moreover, they were afraid of him.  As such a man,
however, was not of much practical use in the ship, especially as he
refused to work except when he pleased, the incredulous captain would
fain have been rid of him; but apprised that that individual's
intention was to land him in the first convenient port, the archangel
forthwith opened all his seals and vials--devoting the ship and all
hands to unconditional perdition, in case this intention was carried
out.  So strongly did he work upon his disciples among the crew, that
at last in a body they went to the captain and told him if Gabriel
was sent from the ship, not a man of them would remain.  He was
therefore forced to relinquish his plan.  Nor would they permit
Gabriel to be any way maltreated, say or do what he would; so that it
came to pass that Gabriel had the complete freedom of the ship.  The
consequence of all this was, that the archangel cared little or
nothing for the captain and mates; and since the epidemic had broken
out, he carried a higher hand than ever; declaring that the plague,
as he called it, was at his sole command; nor should it be stayed but
according to his good pleasure.  The sailors, mostly poor devils,
cringed, and some of them fawned before him; in obedience to his
instructions, sometimes rendering him personal homage, as to a god.
Such things may seem incredible; but, however wondrous, they are
true.  Nor is the history of fanatics half so striking in respect to
the measureless self-deception of the fanatic himself, as his
measureless power of deceiving and bedevilling so many others.  But
it is time to return to the Pequod.

I fear not thy epidemic, man, said Ahab from the bulwarks, to
Captain Mayhew, who stood in the boat's stern; come on board.

But now Gabriel started to his feet.

Think, think of the fevers, yellow and bilious!  Beware of the"
6487	"horrible plague!

Gabriel!  Gabriel! cried Captain Mayhew; thou must either--  But
that instant a headlong wave shot the boat far ahead, and its
seethings drowned all speech.

Hast thou seen the White Whale? demanded Ahab, when the boat
drifted back.

Think, think of thy whale-boat, stoven and sunk!  Beware of the"
6488	"horrible tail!

I tell thee again, Gabriel, that--  But again the boat tore ahead
as if dragged by fiends.  Nothing was said for some moments, while a
succession of riotous waves rolled by, which by one of those
occasional caprices of the seas were tumbling, not heaving it.
Meantime, the hoisted sperm whale's head jogged about very violently,
and Gabriel was seen eyeing it with rather more apprehensiveness than
his archangel nature seemed to warrant.

When this interlude was over, Captain Mayhew began a dark story
concerning Moby Dick; not, however, without frequent interruptions
from Gabriel, whenever his name was mentioned, and the crazy sea that
seemed leagued with him.

It seemed that the Jeroboam had not long left home, when upon
speaking a whale-ship, her people were reliably apprised of the
existence of Moby Dick, and the havoc he had made.  Greedily sucking
in this intelligence, Gabriel solemnly warned the captain against
attacking the White Whale, in case the monster should be seen; in his
gibbering insanity, pronouncing the White Whale to be no less a being
than the Shaker God incarnated; the Shakers receiving the Bible.  But
when, some year or two afterwards, Moby Dick was fairly sighted from
the mast-heads, Macey, the chief mate, burned with ardour to encounter
him; and the captain himself being not unwilling to let him have the
opportunity, despite all the archangel's denunciations and
forewarnings, Macey succeeded in persuading five men to man his boat.
With them he pushed off; and, after much weary pulling, and many
perilous, unsuccessful onsets, he at last succeeded in getting one
iron fast.  Meantime, Gabriel, ascending to the main-royal mast-head,
was tossing one arm in frantic gestures, and hurling forth prophecies
of speedy doom to the sacrilegious assailants of his divinity.  Now,
while Macey, the mate, was standing up in his boat's bow, and with
all the reckless energy of his tribe was venting his wild
exclamations upon the whale, and essaying to get a fair chance for
his poised lance, lo! a broad white shadow rose from the sea; by its
quick, fanning motion, temporarily taking the breath out of the
bodies of the oarsmen.  Next instant, the luckless mate, so full of
furious life, was smitten bodily into the air, and making a long arc
in his descent, fell into the sea at the distance of about fifty
yards.  Not a chip of the boat was harmed, nor a hair of any
oarsman's head; but the mate for ever sank.

It is well to parenthesize here, that of the fatal accidents in the
Sperm-Whale Fishery, this kind is perhaps almost as frequent as any.
Sometimes, nothing is injured but the man who is thus annihilated;
oftener the boat's bow is knocked off, or the thigh-board, in which
the headsman stands, is torn from its place and accompanies the body.
But strangest of all is the circumstance, that in more instances
than one, when the body has been recovered, not a single mark of
violence is discernible; the man being stark dead.

The whole calamity, with the falling form of Macey, was plainly
descried from the ship.  Raising a piercing shriek--The vial! the"
6489	"vial!  Gabriel called off the terror-stricken crew from the further
hunting of the whale.  This terrible event clothed the archangel with
added influence; because his credulous disciples believed that he had
specifically fore-announced it, instead of only making a general
prophecy, which any one might have done, and so have chanced to hit
one of many marks in the wide margin allowed.  He became a nameless
terror to the ship.

Mayhew having concluded his narration, Ahab put such questions to
him, that the stranger captain could not forbear inquiring whether he
intended to hunt the White Whale, if opportunity should offer.  To
which Ahab answered--Aye.  Straightway, then, Gabriel once more
started to his feet, glaring upon the old man, and vehemently
exclaimed, with downward pointed finger--Think, think of the"
6490	"blasphemer--dead, and down there!--beware of the blasphemer's end!

Ahab stolidly turned aside; then said to Mayhew, Captain, I have"
6491	just bethought me of my letter-bag; there is a letter for one of thy
6492	"officers, if I mistake not.  Starbuck, look over the bag.

Every whale-ship takes out a goodly number of letters for various
ships, whose delivery to the persons to whom they may be addressed,
depends upon the mere chance of encountering them in the four oceans.
Thus, most letters never reach their mark; and many are only
received after attaining an age of two or three years or more.

Soon Starbuck returned with a letter in his hand.  It was sorely
tumbled, damp, and covered with a dull, spotted, green mould, in
consequence of being kept in a dark locker of the cabin.  Of such a
letter, Death himself might well have been the post-boy.

Can'st not read it? cried Ahab.  Give it me, man.  Aye, aye, it's"
6493	"but a dim scrawl;--what's this?  As he was studying it out, Starbuck
took a long cutting-spade pole, and with his knife slightly split the
end, to insert the letter there, and in that way, hand it to the
boat, without its coming any closer to the ship.

Meantime, Ahab holding the letter, muttered, Mr. Har--yes, Mr."
6494	Harry--(a woman's pinny hand,--the man's wife, I'll wager)--Aye--Mr.
6495	"Harry Macey, Ship Jeroboam;--why it's Macey, and he's dead!

Poor fellow! poor fellow! and from his wife, sighed Mayhew; but"
6496	"let me have it.

Nay, keep it thyself, cried Gabriel to Ahab; thou art soon going"
6497	"that way.

Curses throttle thee! yelled Ahab.  Captain Mayhew, stand by now"
6498	"to receive it; and taking the fatal missive from Starbuck's hands,
he caught it in the slit of the pole, and reached it over towards the
boat.  But as he did so, the oarsmen expectantly desisted from
rowing; the boat drifted a little towards the ship's stern; so that,
as if by magic, the letter suddenly ranged along with Gabriel's eager
hand.  He clutched it in an instant, seized the boat-knife, and
impaling the letter on it, sent it thus loaded back into the ship.
It fell at Ahab's feet.  Then Gabriel shrieked out to his comrades to
give way with their oars, and in that manner the mutinous boat
rapidly shot away from the Pequod.

As, after this interlude, the seamen resumed their work upon the
jacket of the whale, many strange things were hinted in reference to
this wild affair.



CHAPTER 72

The Monkey-Rope.


In the tumultuous business of cutting-in and attending to a whale,
there is much running backwards and forwards among the crew.  Now
hands are wanted here, and then again hands are wanted there.  There
is no staying in any one place; for at one and the same time
everything has to be done everywhere.  It is much the same with him
who endeavors the description of the scene.  We must now retrace our
way a little.  It was mentioned that upon first breaking ground in
the whale's back, the blubber-hook was inserted into the original
hole there cut by the spades of the mates.  But how did so clumsy and
weighty a mass as that same hook get fixed in that hole?  It was
inserted there by my particular friend Queequeg, whose duty it was,
as harpooneer, to descend upon the monster's back for the special
purpose referred to.  But in very many cases, circumstances require
that the harpooneer shall remain on the whale till the whole tensing
or stripping operation is concluded.  The whale, be it observed, lies
almost entirely submerged, excepting the immediate parts operated
upon.  So down there, some ten feet below the level of the deck, the
poor harpooneer flounders about, half on the whale and half in the
water, as the vast mass revolves like a tread-mill beneath him.  On
the occasion in question, Queequeg figured in the Highland costume--a
shirt and socks--in which to my eyes, at least, he appeared to
uncommon advantage; and no one had a better chance to observe him, as
will presently be seen.

Being the savage's bowsman, that is, the person who pulled the
bow-oar in his boat (the second one from forward), it was my cheerful
duty to attend upon him while taking that hard-scrabble scramble upon
the dead whale's back.  You have seen Italian organ-boys holding a
dancing-ape by a long cord.  Just so, from the ship's steep side, did
I hold Queequeg down there in the sea, by what is technically called
in the fishery a monkey-rope, attached to a strong strip of canvas
belted round his waist.

It was a humorously perilous business for both of us.  For, before we
proceed further, it must be said that the monkey-rope was fast at
both ends; fast to Queequeg's broad canvas belt, and fast to my
narrow leather one.  So that for better or for worse, we two, for the
time, were wedded; and should poor Queequeg sink to rise no more,
then both usage and honour demanded, that instead of cutting the cord,
it should drag me down in his wake.  So, then, an elongated Siamese
ligature united us.  Queequeg was my own inseparable twin brother;
nor could I any way get rid of the dangerous liabilities which the
hempen bond entailed.

So strongly and metaphysically did I conceive of my situation then,
that while earnestly watching his motions, I seemed distinctly to
perceive that my own individuality was now merged in a joint stock
company of two; that my free will had received a mortal wound; and
that another's mistake or misfortune might plunge innocent me into
unmerited disaster and death.  Therefore, I saw that here was a sort
of interregnum in Providence; for its even-handed equity never could
have so gross an injustice.  And yet still further pondering--while I
jerked him now and then from between the whale and ship, which would
threaten to jam him--still further pondering, I say, I saw that this
situation of mine was the precise situation of every mortal that
breathes; only, in most cases, he, one way or other, has this Siamese
connexion with a plurality of other mortals.  If your banker breaks,
you snap; if your apothecary by mistake sends you poison in your
pills, you die.  True, you may say that, by exceeding caution, you
may possibly escape these and the multitudinous other evil chances of
life.  But handle Queequeg's monkey-rope heedfully as I would,
sometimes he jerked it so, that I came very near sliding overboard.
Nor could I possibly forget that, do what I would, I only had the
management of one end of it.*


*The monkey-rope is found in all whalers; but it was only in the
Pequod that the monkey and his holder were ever tied together.  This
improvement upon the original usage was introduced by no less a man
than Stubb, in order to afford the imperilled harpooneer the strongest
possible guarantee for the faithfulness and vigilance of his
monkey-rope holder.


I have hinted that I would often jerk poor Queequeg from between the
whale and the ship--where he would occasionally fall, from the
incessant rolling and swaying of both.  But this was not the only
jamming jeopardy he was exposed to.  Unappalled by the massacre made
upon them during the night, the sharks now freshly and more keenly
allured by the before pent blood which began to flow from the
carcass--the rabid creatures swarmed round it like bees in a beehive.

And right in among those sharks was Queequeg; who often pushed them
aside with his floundering feet.  A thing altogether incredible were
it not that attracted by such prey as a dead whale, the otherwise
miscellaneously carnivorous shark will seldom touch a man.

Nevertheless, it may well be believed that since they have such a
ravenous finger in the pie, it is deemed but wise to look sharp to
them.  Accordingly, besides the monkey-rope, with which I now and
then jerked the poor fellow from too close a vicinity to the maw of
what seemed a peculiarly ferocious shark--he was provided with still
another protection.  Suspended over the side in one of the stages,
Tashtego and Daggoo continually flourished over his head a couple of
keen whale-spades, wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks as they
could reach.  This procedure of theirs, to be sure, was very
disinterested and benevolent of them.  They meant Queequeg's best
happiness, I admit; but in their hasty zeal to befriend him, and from
the circumstance that both he and the sharks were at times half
hidden by the blood-muddled water, those indiscreet spades of theirs
would come nearer amputating a leg than a tall.  But poor Queequeg, I
suppose, straining and gasping there with that great iron hook--poor
Queequeg, I suppose, only prayed to his Yojo, and gave up his life
into the hands of his gods.

Well, well, my dear comrade and twin-brother, thought I, as I drew in
and then slacked off the rope to every swell of the sea--what matters
it, after all?  Are you not the precious image of each and all of us
men in this whaling world?  That unsounded ocean you gasp in, is
Life; those sharks, your foes; those spades, your friends; and what
between sharks and spades you are in a sad pickle and peril, poor
lad.

But courage! there is good cheer in store for you, Queequeg.  For
now, as with blue lips and blood-shot eyes the exhausted savage at
last climbs up the chains and stands all dripping and involuntarily
trembling over the side; the steward advances, and with a benevolent,
consolatory glance hands him--what?  Some hot Cognac?  No! hands him,
ye gods! hands him a cup of tepid ginger and water!

Ginger?  Do I smell ginger? suspiciously asked Stubb, coming near.
Yes, this must be ginger, peering into the as yet untasted cup.
Then standing as if incredulous for a while, he calmly walked towards
the astonished steward slowly saying, Ginger? ginger? and will you"
6499	have the goodness to tell me, Mr. Dough-Boy, where lies the virtue of
6500	ginger?  Ginger! is ginger the sort of fuel you use, Dough-boy, to
6501	kindle a fire in this shivering cannibal?  Ginger!--what the devil is
6502	ginger?--sea-coal? firewood?--lucifer
6503	matches?--tinder?--gunpowder?--what the devil is ginger, I say, that
6504	"you offer this cup to our poor Queequeg here.

There is some sneaking Temperance Society movement about this"
6505	"business, he suddenly added, now approaching Starbuck, who had just
come from forward.  Will you look at that kannakin, sir; smell of"
6506	"it, if you please.  Then watching the mate's countenance, he added,
The steward, Mr. Starbuck, had the face to offer that calomel and"
6507	jalap to Queequeg, there, this instant off the whale.  Is the steward
6508	an apothecary, sir? and may I ask whether this is the sort of bitters
6509	"by which he blows back the life into a half-drowned man?

I trust not, said Starbuck, it is poor stuff enough.

Aye, aye, steward, cried Stubb, we'll teach you to drug it"
6510	harpooneer; none of your apothecary's medicine here; you want to
6511	poison us, do ye?  You have got out insurances on our lives and want
6512	"to murder us all, and pocket the proceeds, do ye?

It was not me, cried Dough-Boy, it was Aunt Charity that brought"
6513	the ginger on board; and bade me never give the harpooneers any
6514	"spirits, but only this ginger-jub--so she called it.

Ginger-jub! you gingerly rascal! take that! and run along with ye to"
6515	the lockers, and get something better.  I hope I do no wrong, Mr.
6516	Starbuck.  It is the captain's orders--grog for the harpooneer on a
6517	"whale.

Enough, replied Starbuck, only don't hit him again, but--

Oh, I never hurt when I hit, except when I hit a whale or something"
6518	of that sort; and this fellow's a weazel.  What were you about
6519	"saying, sir?

Only this: go down with him, and get what thou wantest thyself.

When Stubb reappeared, he came with a dark flask in one hand, and a
sort of tea-caddy in the other.  The first contained strong spirits,
and was handed to Queequeg; the second was Aunt Charity's gift, and
that was freely given to the waves.



CHAPTER 73

Stubb and Flask Kill a Right Whale; and Then Have a Talk Over Him.


It must be borne in mind that all this time we have a Sperm Whale's
prodigious head hanging to the Pequod's side.  But we must let it
continue hanging there a while till we can get a chance to attend to
it.  For the present other matters press, and the best we can do now
for the head, is to pray heaven the tackles may hold.

Now, during the past night and forenoon, the Pequod had gradually
drifted into a sea, which, by its occasional patches of yellow brit,
gave unusual tokens of the vicinity of Right Whales, a species of the
Leviathan that but few supposed to be at this particular time lurking
anywhere near.  And though all hands commonly disdained the capture
of those inferior creatures; and though the Pequod was not
commissioned to cruise for them at all, and though she had passed
numbers of them near the Crozetts without lowering a boat; yet now
that a Sperm Whale had been brought alongside and beheaded, to the
surprise of all, the announcement was made that a Right Whale should
be captured that day, if opportunity offered.

Nor was this long wanting.  Tall spouts were seen to leeward; and two
boats, Stubb's and Flask's, were detached in pursuit.  Pulling
further and further away, they at last became almost invisible to the
men at the mast-head.  But suddenly in the distance, they saw a great
heap of tumultuous white water, and soon after news came from aloft
that one or both the boats must be fast.  An interval passed and the
boats were in plain sight, in the act of being dragged right towards
the ship by the towing whale.  So close did the monster come to the
hull, that at first it seemed as if he meant it malice; but suddenly
going down in a maelstrom, within three rods of the planks, he wholly
disappeared from view, as if diving under the keel.  Cut, cut! was
the cry from the ship to the boats, which, for one instant, seemed on
the point of being brought with a deadly dash against the vessel's
side.  But having plenty of line yet in the tubs, and the whale not
sounding very rapidly, they paid out abundance of rope, and at the
same time pulled with all their might so as to get ahead of the ship.
For a few minutes the struggle was intensely critical; for while
they still slacked out the tightened line in one direction, and still
plied their oars in another, the contending strain threatened to take
them under.  But it was only a few feet advance they sought to gain.
And they stuck to it till they did gain it; when instantly, a swift
tremor was felt running like lightning along the keel, as the
strained line, scraping beneath the ship, suddenly rose to view under
her bows, snapping and quivering; and so flinging off its drippings,
that the drops fell like bits of broken glass on the water, while the
whale beyond also rose to sight, and once more the boats were free to
fly.  But the fagged whale abated his speed, and blindly altering his
course, went round the stern of the ship towing the two boats after
him, so that they performed a complete circuit.

Meantime, they hauled more and more upon their lines, till close
flanking him on both sides, Stubb answered Flask with lance for
lance; and thus round and round the Pequod the battle went, while the
multitudes of sharks that had before swum round the Sperm Whale's
body, rushed to the fresh blood that was spilled, thirstily drinking
at every new gash, as the eager Israelites did at the new bursting
fountains that poured from the smitten rock.

At last his spout grew thick, and with a frightful roll and vomit, he
turned upon his back a corpse.

While the two headsmen were engaged in making fast cords to his
flukes, and in other ways getting the mass in readiness for towing,
some conversation ensued between them.

I wonder what the old man wants with this lump of foul lard, said
Stubb, not without some disgust at the thought of having to do with
so ignoble a leviathan.

Wants with it? said Flask, coiling some spare line in the boat's
bow, did you never hear that the ship which but once has a Sperm"
6520	Whale's head hoisted on her starboard side, and at the same time a
6521	Right Whale's on the larboard; did you never hear, Stubb, that that
6522	"ship can never afterwards capsize?

Why not?"
6523	
6524	"I don't know, but I heard that gamboge ghost of a Fedallah saying
so, and he seems to know all about ships' charms.  But I sometimes
think he'll charm the ship to no good at last.  I don't half like
that chap, Stubb.  Did you ever notice how that tusk of his is a sort
of carved into a snake's head, Stubb?"
6525	
6526	"Sink him!  I never look at him at all; but if ever I get a chance of
a dark night, and he standing hard by the bulwarks, and no one by;
look down there, Flask--pointing into the sea with a peculiar motion"
6527	"of both hands--Aye, will I!  Flask, I take that Fedallah to be the
devil in disguise.  Do you believe that cock and bull story about his
having been stowed away on board ship?  He's the devil, I say.  The
reason why you don't see his tail, is because he tucks it up out of
sight; he carries it coiled away in his pocket, I guess.  Blast him!
now that I think of it, he's always wanting oakum to stuff into the
toes of his boots."
6528	
6529	"He sleeps in his boots, don't he?  He hasn't got any hammock; but
I've seen him lay of nights in a coil of rigging."
6530	
6531	"No doubt, and it's because of his cursed tail; he coils it down, do
ye see, in the eye of the rigging."
6532	
6533	What's the old man have so much to do with him for?
6534	
6535	Striking up a swap or a bargain, I suppose.
6536	
6537	Bargain?--about what?
6538	
6539	"Why, do ye see, the old man is hard bent after that White Whale, and
the devil there is trying to come round him, and get him to swap away
his silver watch, or his soul, or something of that sort, and then
he'll surrender Moby Dick."
6540	
6541	Pooh!  Stubb, you are skylarking; how can Fedallah do that?
6542	
6543	"I don't know, Flask, but the devil is a curious chap, and a wicked
one, I tell ye.  Why, they say as how he went a sauntering into the
old flag-ship once, switching his tail about devilish easy and
gentlemanlike, and inquiring if the old governor was at home.  Well,
he was at home, and asked the devil what he wanted.  The devil,
switching his hoofs, up and says, 'I want John.'  'What for?' says
the old governor.  'What business is that of yours,' says the devil,
getting mad,--'I want to use him.'  'Take him,' says the
governor--and by the Lord, Flask, if the devil didn't give John the
Asiatic cholera before he got through with him, I'll eat this whale
in one mouthful.  But look sharp--ain't you all ready there?  Well,
then, pull ahead, and let's get the whale alongside."
6544	
6545	I think I remember some such story as you were telling, said Flask,
6546	when at last the two boats were slowly advancing with their burden
6547	towards the ship, but I can't remember where.
6548	
6549	"Three Spaniards?  Adventures of those three bloody-minded soladoes?
Did ye read it there, Flask?  I guess ye did?"
6550	
6551	"No: never saw such a book; heard of it, though.  But now, tell me,
Stubb, do you suppose that that devil you was speaking of just now,
was the same you say is now on board the Pequod?"
6552	
6553	"Am I the same man that helped kill this whale?  Doesn't the devil
live for ever; who ever heard that the devil was dead?  Did you ever
see any parson a wearing mourning for the devil?  And if the devil
has a latch-key to get into the admiral's cabin, don't you suppose he
can crawl into a porthole?  Tell me that, Mr. Flask?"
6554	
6555	How old do you suppose Fedallah is, Stubb?
6556	
6557	"Do you see that mainmast there? pointing to the ship; well, that's
the figure one; now take all the hoops in the Pequod's hold, and
string along in a row with that mast, for oughts, do you see; well,
that wouldn't begin to be Fedallah's age.  Nor all the coopers in
creation couldn't show hoops enough to make oughts enough."
6558	
6559	"But see here, Stubb, I thought you a little boasted just now, that
you meant to give Fedallah a sea-toss, if you got a good chance.
Now, if he's so old as all those hoops of yours come to, and if he is
going to live for ever, what good will it do to pitch him
overboard--tell me that?

Give him a good ducking, anyhow.

But he'd crawl back.

Duck him again; and keep ducking him.

Suppose he should take it into his head to duck you, though--yes,"
6560	"and drown you--what then?

I should like to see him try it; I'd give him such a pair of black"
6561	eyes that he wouldn't dare to show his face in the admiral's cabin
6562	again for a long while, let alone down in the orlop there, where he
6563	lives, and hereabouts on the upper decks where he sneaks so much.
6564	Damn the devil, Flask; so you suppose I'm afraid of the devil?  Who's
6565	afraid of him, except the old governor who daresn't catch him and put
6566	him in double-darbies, as he deserves, but lets him go about
6567	kidnapping people; aye, and signed a bond with him, that all the
6568	"people the devil kidnapped, he'd roast for him?  There's a governor!

Do you suppose Fedallah wants to kidnap Captain Ahab?

Do I suppose it?  You'll know it before long, Flask.  But I am going"
6569	now to keep a sharp look-out on him; and if I see anything very
6570	suspicious going on, I'll just take him by the nape of his neck, and
6571	say--Look here, Beelzebub, you don't do it; and if he makes any fuss,
6572	by the Lord I'll make a grab into his pocket for his tail, take it to
6573	the capstan, and give him such a wrenching and heaving, that his tail
6574	will come short off at the stump--do you see; and then, I rather
6575	guess when he finds himself docked in that queer fashion, he'll sneak
6576	off without the poor satisfaction of feeling his tail between his
6577	"legs.

And what will you do with the tail, Stubb?

Do with it?  Sell it for an ox whip when we get home;--what else?

Now, do you mean what you say, and have been saying all along,"
6578	"Stubb?

Mean or not mean, here we are at the ship.

The boats were here hailed, to tow the whale on the larboard side,
where fluke chains and other necessaries were already prepared for
securing him.

Didn't I tell you so? said Flask; yes, you'll soon see this right"
6579	"whale's head hoisted up opposite that parmacetti's.

In good time, Flask's saying proved true.  As before, the Pequod
steeply leaned over towards the sperm whale's head, now, by the
counterpoise of both heads, she regained her even keel; though sorely
strained, you may well believe.  So, when on one side you hoist in
Locke's head, you go over that way; but now, on the other side, hoist
in Kant's and you come back again; but in very poor plight.  Thus,
some minds for ever keep trimming boat.  Oh, ye foolish! throw all
these thunder-heads overboard, and then you will float light and
right.

In disposing of the body of a right whale, when brought alongside the
ship, the same preliminary proceedings commonly take place as in the
case of a sperm whale; only, in the latter instance, the head is cut
off whole, but in the former the lips and tongue are separately
removed and hoisted on deck, with all the well known black bone
attached to what is called the crown-piece.  But nothing like this,
in the present case, had been done.  The carcases of both whales had
dropped astern; and the head-laden ship not a little resembled a mule
carrying a pair of overburdening panniers.

Meantime, Fedallah was calmly eyeing the right whale's head, and ever
and anon glancing from the deep wrinkles there to the lines in his
own hand.  And Ahab chanced so to stand, that the Parsee occupied his
shadow; while, if the Parsee's shadow was there at all it seemed only
to blend with, and lengthen Ahab's.  As the crew toiled on,
Laplandish speculations were bandied among them, concerning all these
passing things.



CHAPTER 74

The Sperm Whale's Head--Contrasted View.


Here, now, are two great whales, laying their heads together; let us
join them, and lay together our own.

Of the grand order of folio leviathans, the Sperm Whale and the Right
Whale are by far the most noteworthy.  They are the only whales
regularly hunted by man.  To the Nantucketer, they present the two
extremes of all the known varieties of the whale.  As the external
difference between them is mainly observable in their heads; and as a
head of each is this moment hanging from the Pequod's side; and as we
may freely go from one to the other, by merely stepping across the
deck:--where, I should like to know, will you obtain a better chance
to study practical cetology than here?

In the first place, you are struck by the general contrast between
these heads.  Both are massive enough in all conscience; but there
is a certain mathematical symmetry in the Sperm Whale's which the
Right Whale's sadly lacks.  There is more character in the Sperm
Whale's head.  As you behold it, you involuntarily yield the immense
superiority to him, in point of pervading dignity.  In the present
instance, too, this dignity is heightened by the pepper and salt
colour of his head at the summit, giving token of advanced age and
large experience.  In short, he is what the fishermen technically
call a grey-headed whale.

Let us now note what is least dissimilar in these heads--namely, the
two most important organs, the eye and the ear.  Far back on the side
of the head, and low down, near the angle of either whale's jaw, if
you narrowly search, you will at last see a lashless eye, which you
would fancy to be a young colt's eye; so out of all proportion is it
to the magnitude of the head.

Now, from this peculiar sideway position of the whale's eyes, it is
plain that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead, no more
than he can one exactly astern.  In a word, the position of the
whale's eyes corresponds to that of a man's ears; and you may fancy,
for yourself, how it would fare with you, did you sideways survey
objects through your ears.  You would find that you could only
command some thirty degrees of vision in advance of the straight
side-line of sight; and about thirty more behind it.  If your
bitterest foe were walking straight towards you, with dagger uplifted
in broad day, you would not be able to see him, any more than if he
were stealing upon you from behind.  In a word, you would have two
backs, so to speak; but, at the same time, also, two fronts (side
fronts): for what is it that makes the front of a man--what, indeed,
but his eyes?

Moreover, while in most other animals that I can now think of, the
eyes are so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power, so
as to produce one picture and not two to the brain; the peculiar
position of the whale's eyes, effectually divided as they are by many
cubic feet of solid head, which towers between them like a great
mountain separating two lakes in valleys; this, of course, must
wholly separate the impressions which each independent organ imparts.
The whale, therefore, must see one distinct picture on this side,
and another distinct picture on that side; while all between must be
profound darkness and nothingness to him.  Man may, in effect, be
said to look out on the world from a sentry-box with two joined
sashes for his window.  But with the whale, these two sashes are
separately inserted, making two distinct windows, but sadly impairing
the view.  This peculiarity of the whale's eyes is a thing always to
be borne in mind in the fishery; and to be remembered by the reader
in some subsequent scenes.

A curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this
visual matter as touching the Leviathan.  But I must be content with
a hint.  So long as a man's eyes are open in the light, the act of
seeing is involuntary; that is, he cannot then help mechanically
seeing whatever objects are before him.  Nevertheless, any one's
experience will teach him, that though he can take in an
undiscriminating sweep of things at one glance, it is quite
impossible for him, attentively, and completely, to examine any two
things--however large or however small--at one and the same instant
of time; never mind if they lie side by side and touch each other.
But if you now come to separate these two objects, and surround each
by a circle of profound darkness; then, in order to see one of them,
in such a manner as to bring your mind to bear on it, the other will
be utterly excluded from your contemporary consciousness.  How is it,
then, with the whale?  True, both his eyes, in themselves, must
simultaneously act; but is his brain so much more comprehensive,
combining, and subtle than man's, that he can at the same moment of
time attentively examine two distinct prospects, one on one side of
him, and the other in an exactly opposite direction?  If he can, then
is it as marvellous a thing in him, as if a man were able
simultaneously to go through the demonstrations of two distinct
problems in Euclid.  Nor, strictly investigated, is there any
incongruity in this comparison.

It may be but an idle whim, but it has always seemed to me, that the
extraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales when
beset by three or four boats; the timidity and liability to queer
frights, so common to such whales; I think that all this indirectly
proceeds from the helpless perplexity of volition, in which their
divided and diametrically opposite powers of vision must involve
them.

But the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eye.  If you are
an entire stranger to their race, you might hunt over these two heads
for hours, and never discover that organ.  The ear has no external
leaf whatever; and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a
quill, so wondrously minute is it.  It is lodged a little behind the
eye.  With respect to their ears, this important difference is to be
observed between the sperm whale and the right.  While the ear of
the former has an external opening, that of the latter is entirely
and evenly covered over with a membrane, so as to be quite
imperceptible from without.

Is it not curious, that so vast a being as the whale should see the
world through so small an eye, and hear the thunder through an ear
which is smaller than a hare's?  But if his eyes were broad as the
lens of Herschel's great telescope; and his ears capacious as the
porches of cathedrals; would that make him any longer of sight, or
sharper of hearing?  Not at all.--Why then do you try to enlarge
your mind?  Subtilize it.

Let us now with whatever levers and steam-engines we have at hand,
cant over the sperm whale's head, that it may lie bottom up;
then, ascending by a ladder to the summit, have a peep down the
mouth; and were it not that the body is now completely separated from
it, with a lantern we might descend into the great Kentucky Mammoth
Cave of his stomach.  But let us hold on here by this tooth, and look
about us where we are.  What a really beautiful and chaste-looking
mouth! from floor to ceiling, lined, or rather papered with a
glistening white membrane, glossy as bridal satins.

But come out now, and look at this portentous lower jaw, which seems
like the long narrow lid of an immense snuff-box, with the hinge at
one end, instead of one side.  If you pry it up, so as to get it
overhead, and expose its rows of teeth, it seems a terrific
portcullis; and such, alas! it proves to many a poor wight in the
fishery, upon whom these spikes fall with impaling force.  But far
more terrible is it to behold, when fathoms down in the sea, you see
some sulky whale, floating there suspended, with his prodigious jaw,
some fifteen feet long, hanging straight down at right-angles with
his body, for all the world like a ship's jib-boom.  This whale is
not dead; he is only dispirited; out of sorts, perhaps;
hypochondriac; and so supine, that the hinges of his jaw have
relaxed, leaving him there in that ungainly sort of plight, a
reproach to all his tribe, who must, no doubt, imprecate lock-jaws
upon him.

In most cases this lower jaw--being easily unhinged by a practised
artist--is disengaged and hoisted on deck for the purpose of
extracting the ivory teeth, and furnishing a supply of that hard
white whalebone with which the fishermen fashion all sorts of curious
articles, including canes, umbrella-stocks, and handles to
riding-whips.

With a long, weary hoist the jaw is dragged on board, as if it were
an anchor; and when the proper time comes--some few days after the
other work--Queequeg, Daggoo, and Tashtego, being all accomplished
dentists, are set to drawing teeth.  With a keen cutting-spade,
Queequeg lances the gums; then the jaw is lashed down to ringbolts,
and a tackle being rigged from aloft, they drag out these teeth, as
Michigan oxen drag stumps of old oaks out of wild wood lands.  There
are generally forty-two teeth in all; in old whales, much worn down,
but undecayed; nor filled after our artificial fashion.  The jaw is
afterwards sawn into slabs, and piled away like joists for building
houses.



CHAPTER 75

The Right Whale's Head--Contrasted View.


Crossing the deck, let us now have a good long look at the Right
Whale's head.

As in general shape the noble Sperm Whale's head may be compared to a
Roman war-chariot (especially in front, where it is so broadly
rounded); so, at a broad view, the Right Whale's head bears a rather
inelegant resemblance to a gigantic galliot-toed shoe.  Two hundred
years ago an old Dutch voyager likened its shape to that of a
shoemaker's last.  And in this same last or shoe, that old woman of
the nursery tale, with the swarming brood, might very comfortably be
lodged, she and all her progeny.

But as you come nearer to this great head it begins to assume
different aspects, according to your point of view.  If you stand on
its summit and look at these two F-shaped spoutholes, you would take
the whole head for an enormous bass-viol, and these spiracles, the
apertures in its sounding-board.  Then, again, if you fix your eye
upon this strange, crested, comb-like incrustation on the top of the
mass--this green, barnacled thing, which the Greenlanders call the
crown, and the Southern fishers the bonnet of the Right Whale;
fixing your eyes solely on this, you would take the head for the
trunk of some huge oak, with a bird's nest in its crotch.  At any
rate, when you watch those live crabs that nestle here on this
bonnet, such an idea will be almost sure to occur to you; unless,
indeed, your fancy has been fixed by the technical term crown also
bestowed upon it; in which case you will take great interest in
thinking how this mighty monster is actually a diademed king of the
sea, whose green crown has been put together for him in this
marvellous manner.  But if this whale be a king, he is a very sulky
looking fellow to grace a diadem.  Look at that hanging lower lip!
what a huge sulk and pout is there! a sulk and pout, by carpenter's
measurement, about twenty feet long and five feet deep; a sulk and
pout that will yield you some 500 gallons of oil and more.

A great pity, now, that this unfortunate whale should be hare-lipped.
The fissure is about a foot across.  Probably the mother during an
important interval was sailing down the Peruvian coast, when
earthquakes caused the beach to gape.  Over this lip, as over a
slippery threshold, we now slide into the mouth.  Upon my word were I
at Mackinaw, I should take this to be the inside of an Indian wigwam.
Good Lord! is this the road that Jonah went?  The roof is about
twelve feet high, and runs to a pretty sharp angle, as if there were
a regular ridge-pole there; while these ribbed, arched, hairy sides,
present us with those wondrous, half vertical, scimetar-shaped slats
of whalebone, say three hundred on a side, which depending from the
upper part of the head or crown bone, form those Venetian blinds
which have elsewhere been cursorily mentioned.  The edges of these
bones are fringed with hairy fibres, through which the Right Whale
strains the water, and in whose intricacies he retains the small
fish, when openmouthed he goes through the seas of brit in feeding
time.  In the central blinds of bone, as they stand in their natural
order, there are certain curious marks, curves, hollows, and ridges,
whereby some whalemen calculate the creature's age, as the age of an
oak by its circular rings.  Though the certainty of this criterion is
far from demonstrable, yet it has the savor of analogical
probability.  At any rate, if we yield to it, we must grant a far
greater age to the Right Whale than at first glance will seem
reasonable.

In old times, there seem to have prevailed the most curious fancies
concerning these blinds.  One voyager in Purchas calls them the
wondrous whiskers inside of the whale's mouth;* another, hogs'"
6580	"bristles; a third old gentleman in Hackluyt uses the following
elegant language: There are about two hundred and fifty fins growing"
6581	on each side of his upper CHOP, which arch over his tongue on each
6582	"side of his mouth.


*This reminds us that the Right Whale really has a sort of whisker,
or rather a moustache, consisting of a few scattered white hairs on
the upper part of the outer end of the lower jaw.  Sometimes these
tufts impart a rather brigandish expression to his otherwise solemn
countenance.


As every one knows, these same hogs' bristles, fins, whiskers,
blinds, or whatever you please, furnish to the ladies their busks
and other stiffening contrivances.  But in this particular, the
demand has long been on the decline.  It was in Queen Anne's time
that the bone was in its glory, the farthingale being then all the
fashion.  And as those ancient dames moved about gaily, though in the
jaws of the whale, as you may say; even so, in a shower, with the
like thoughtlessness, do we nowadays fly under the same jaws for
protection; the umbrella being a tent spread over the same bone.

But now forget all about blinds and whiskers for a moment, and,
standing in the Right Whale's mouth, look around you afresh.  Seeing
all these colonnades of bone so methodically ranged about, would you
not think you were inside of the great Haarlem organ, and gazing
upon its thousand pipes?  For a carpet to the organ we have a rug of
the softest Turkey--the tongue, which is glued, as it were, to the
floor of the mouth.  It is very fat and tender, and apt to tear in
pieces in hoisting it on deck.  This particular tongue now before us;
at a passing glance I should say it was a six-barreler; that is, it
will yield you about that amount of oil.

Ere this, you must have plainly seen the truth of what I started
with--that the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale have almost entirely
different heads.  To sum up, then: in the Right Whale's there is no
great well of sperm; no ivory teeth at all; no long, slender mandible
of a lower jaw, like the Sperm Whale's.  Nor in the Sperm Whale are
there any of those blinds of bone; no huge lower lip; and scarcely
anything of a tongue.  Again, the Right Whale has two external
spout-holes, the Sperm Whale only one.

Look your last, now, on these venerable hooded heads, while they yet
lie together; for one will soon sink, unrecorded, in the sea; the
other will not be very long in following.

Can you catch the expression of the Sperm Whale's there?  It is the
same he died with, only some of the longer wrinkles in the forehead
seem now faded away.  I think his broad brow to be full of a
prairie-like placidity, born of a speculative indifference as to
death.  But mark the other head's expression.  See that amazing lower
lip, pressed by accident against the vessel's side, so as firmly to
embrace the jaw.  Does not this whole head seem to speak of an
enormous practical resolution in facing death?  This Right Whale I
take to have been a Stoic; the Sperm Whale, a Platonian, who might
have taken up Spinoza in his latter years.



CHAPTER 76

The Battering-Ram.


Ere quitting, for the nonce, the Sperm Whale's head, I would have
you, as a sensible physiologist, simply--particularly remark its
front aspect, in all its compacted collectedness.  I would have you
investigate it now with the sole view of forming to yourself some
unexaggerated, intelligent estimate of whatever battering-ram power
may be lodged there.  Here is a vital point; for you must either
satisfactorily settle this matter with yourself, or for ever remain
an infidel as to one of the most appalling, but not the less true
events, perhaps anywhere to be found in all recorded history.

You observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the Sperm
Whale, the front of his head presents an almost wholly vertical plane
to the water; you observe that the lower part of that front slopes
considerably backwards, so as to furnish more of a retreat for the
long socket which receives the boom-like lower jaw; you observe that
the mouth is entirely under the head, much in the same way, indeed,
as though your own mouth were entirely under your chin.  Moreover you
observe that the whale has no external nose; and that what nose he
has--his spout hole--is on the top of his head; you observe that his
eyes and ears are at the sides of his head, nearly one third of his
entire length from the front.  Wherefore, you must now have perceived
that the front of the Sperm Whale's head is a dead, blind wall,
without a single organ or tender prominence of any sort whatsoever.
Furthermore, you are now to consider that only in the extreme, lower,
backward sloping part of the front of the head, is there the
slightest vestige of bone; and not till you get near twenty feet from
the forehead do you come to the full cranial development.  So that
this whole enormous boneless mass is as one wad.  Finally, though, as
will soon be revealed, its contents partly comprise the most delicate
oil; yet, you are now to be apprised of the nature of the substance
which so impregnably invests all that apparent effeminacy.  In some
previous place I have described to you how the blubber wraps the body
of the whale, as the rind wraps an orange.  Just so with the head;
but with this difference: about the head this envelope, though not so
thick, is of a boneless toughness, inestimable by any man who has not
handled it.  The severest pointed harpoon, the sharpest lance darted
by the strongest human arm, impotently rebounds from it.  It is as
though the forehead of the Sperm Whale were paved with horses' hoofs.
I do not think that any sensation lurks in it.

Bethink yourself also of another thing.  When two large, loaded
Indiamen chance to crowd and crush towards each other in the
docks, what do the sailors do?  They do not suspend between them, at
the point of coming contact, any merely hard substance, like iron or
wood.  No, they hold there a large, round wad of tow and cork,
enveloped in the thickest and toughest of ox-hide.  That bravely and
uninjured takes the jam which would have snapped all their oaken
handspikes and iron crow-bars.  By itself this sufficiently
illustrates the obvious fact I drive at.  But supplementary to this,
it has hypothetically occurred to me, that as ordinary fish possess
what is called a swimming bladder in them, capable, at will, of
distension or contraction; and as the Sperm Whale, as far as I know,
has no such provision in him; considering, too, the otherwise
inexplicable manner in which he now depresses his head altogether
beneath the surface, and anon swims with it high elevated out of the
water; considering the unobstructed elasticity of its envelope;
considering the unique interior of his head; it has hypothetically
occurred to me, I say, that those mystical lung-celled honeycombs
there may possibly have some hitherto unknown and unsuspected
connexion with the outer air, so as to be susceptible to atmospheric
distension and contraction.  If this be so, fancy the
irresistibleness of that might, to which the most impalpable and
destructive of all elements contributes.

Now, mark.  Unerringly impelling this dead, impregnable, uninjurable
wall, and this most buoyant thing within; there swims behind it all a
mass of tremendous life, only to be adequately estimated as piled
wood is--by the cord; and all obedient to one volition, as the
smallest insect.  So that when I shall hereafter detail to you all
the specialities and concentrations of potency everywhere lurking in
this expansive monster; when I shall show you some of his more
inconsiderable braining feats; I trust you will have renounced all
ignorant incredulity, and be ready to abide by this; that though the
Sperm Whale stove a passage through the Isthmus of Darien, and mixed
the Atlantic with the Pacific, you would not elevate one hair of your
eye-brow.  For unless you own the whale, you are but a provincial and
sentimentalist in Truth.  But clear Truth is a thing for salamander
giants only to encounter; how small the chances for the provincials
then?  What befell the weakling youth lifting the dread goddess's
veil at Lais?



CHAPTER 77

The Great Heidelburgh Tun.


Now comes the Baling of the Case.  But to comprehend it aright, you
must know something of the curious internal structure of the thing
operated upon.

Regarding the Sperm Whale's head as a solid oblong, you may, on an
inclined plane, sideways divide it into two quoins,* whereof the
lower is the bony structure, forming the cranium and jaws, and the
upper an unctuous mass wholly free from bones; its broad forward end
forming the expanded vertical apparent forehead of the whale.  At the
middle of the forehead horizontally subdivide this upper quoin, and
then you have two almost equal parts, which before were naturally
divided by an internal wall of a thick tendinous substance.


*Quoin is not a Euclidean term.  It belongs to the pure nautical
mathematics.  I know not that it has been defined before.  A quoin is
a solid which differs from a wedge in having its sharp end formed by
the steep inclination of one side, instead of the mutual tapering of
both sides.


The lower subdivided part, called the junk, is one immense honeycomb
of oil, formed by the crossing and recrossing, into ten thousand
infiltrated cells, of tough elastic white fibres throughout its whole
extent.  The upper part, known as the Case, may be regarded as the
great Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale.  And as that famous great
tierce is mystically carved in front, so the whale's vast plaited
forehead forms innumerable strange devices for the emblematical
adornment of his wondrous tun.  Moreover, as that of Heidelburgh was
always replenished with the most excellent of the wines of the
Rhenish valleys, so the tun of the whale contains by far the most
precious of all his oily vintages; namely, the highly-prized
spermaceti, in its absolutely pure, limpid, and odoriferous state.
Nor is this precious substance found unalloyed in any other part of
the creature.  Though in life it remains perfectly fluid, yet, upon
exposure to the air, after death, it soon begins to concrete; sending
forth beautiful crystalline shoots, as when the first thin delicate
ice is just forming in water.  A large whale's case generally yields
about five hundred gallons of sperm, though from unavoidable
circumstances, considerable of it is spilled, leaks, and dribbles
away, or is otherwise irrevocably lost in the ticklish business of
securing what you can.

I know not with what fine and costly material the Heidelburgh Tun was
coated within, but in superlative richness that coating could not
possibly have compared with the silken pearl-coloured membrane, like
the lining of a fine pelisse, forming the inner surface of the Sperm
Whale's case.

It will have been seen that the Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale
embraces the entire length of the entire top of the head; and
since--as has been elsewhere set forth--the head embraces one third
of the whole length of the creature, then setting that length down at
eighty feet for a good sized whale, you have more than twenty-six
feet for the depth of the tun, when it is lengthwise hoisted up and
down against a ship's side.

As in decapitating the whale, the operator's instrument is brought
close to the spot where an entrance is subsequently forced into the
spermaceti magazine; he has, therefore, to be uncommonly heedful,
lest a careless, untimely stroke should invade the sanctuary and
wastingly let out its invaluable contents.  It is this decapitated
end of the head, also, which is at last elevated out of the water,
and retained in that position by the enormous cutting tackles, whose
hempen combinations, on one side, make quite a wilderness of ropes in
that quarter.

Thus much being said, attend now, I pray you, to that marvellous
and--in this particular instance--almost fatal operation whereby the
Sperm Whale's great Heidelburgh Tun is tapped.



CHAPTER 78

Cistern and Buckets.


Nimble as a cat, Tashtego mounts aloft; and without altering his
erect posture, runs straight out upon the overhanging mainyard-arm,
to the part where it exactly projects over the hoisted Tun.  He has
carried with him a light tackle called a whip, consisting of only two
parts, travelling through a single-sheaved block.  Securing this
block, so that it hangs down from the yard-arm, he swings one end of
the rope, till it is caught and firmly held by a hand on deck.
Then, hand-over-hand, down the other part, the Indian drops through
the air, till dexterously he lands on the summit of the head.
There--still high elevated above the rest of the company, to whom he
vivaciously cries--he seems some Turkish Muezzin calling the good
people to prayers from the top of a tower.  A short-handled sharp
spade being sent up to him, he diligently searches for the proper
place to begin breaking into the Tun.  In this business he proceeds
very heedfully, like a treasure-hunter in some old house, sounding
the walls to find where the gold is masoned in.  By the time this
cautious search is over, a stout iron-bound bucket, precisely like a
well-bucket, has been attached to one end of the whip; while the
other end, being stretched across the deck, is there held by two or
three alert hands.  These last now hoist the bucket within grasp of
the Indian, to whom another person has reached up a very long pole.
Inserting this pole into the bucket, Tashtego downward guides the
bucket into the Tun, till it entirely disappears; then giving the
word to the seamen at the whip, up comes the bucket again, all
bubbling like a dairy-maid's pail of new milk.  Carefully lowered
from its height, the full-freighted vessel is caught by an appointed
hand, and quickly emptied into a large tub.  Then remounting aloft,
it again goes through the same round until the deep cistern will
yield no more.  Towards the end, Tashtego has to ram his long pole
harder and harder, and deeper and deeper into the Tun, until some
twenty feet of the pole have gone down.

Now, the people of the Pequod had been baling some time in this way;
several tubs had been filled with the fragrant sperm; when all at
once a queer accident happened.  Whether it was that Tashtego, that
wild Indian, was so heedless and reckless as to let go for a moment
his one-handed hold on the great cabled tackles suspending the head;
or whether the place where he stood was so treacherous and oozy; or
whether the Evil One himself would have it to fall out so, without
stating his particular reasons; how it was exactly, there is no
telling now; but, on a sudden, as the eightieth or ninetieth bucket
came suckingly up--my God! poor Tashtego--like the twin reciprocating
bucket in a veritable well, dropped head-foremost down into this
great Tun of Heidelburgh, and with a horrible oily gurgling, went
clean out of sight!

Man overboard! cried Daggoo, who amid the general consternation
first came to his senses.  Swing the bucket this way! and putting
one foot into it, so as the better to secure his slippery hand-hold
on the whip itself, the hoisters ran him high up to the top of the
head, almost before Tashtego could have reached its interior bottom.
Meantime, there was a terrible tumult.  Looking over the side, they
saw the before lifeless head throbbing and heaving just below the
surface of the sea, as if that moment seized with some momentous
idea; whereas it was only the poor Indian unconsciously revealing by
those struggles the perilous depth to which he had sunk.

At this instant, while Daggoo, on the summit of the head, was
clearing the whip--which had somehow got foul of the great cutting
tackles--a sharp cracking noise was heard; and to the unspeakable
horror of all, one of the two enormous hooks suspending the head tore
out, and with a vast vibration the enormous mass sideways swung, till
the drunk ship reeled and shook as if smitten by an iceberg.  The one
remaining hook, upon which the entire strain now depended, seemed
every instant to be on the point of giving way; an event still more
likely from the violent motions of the head.

Come down, come down! yelled the seamen to Daggoo, but with one
hand holding on to the heavy tackles, so that if the head should
drop, he would still remain suspended; the negro having cleared the
foul line, rammed down the bucket into the now collapsed well,
meaning that the buried harpooneer should grasp it, and so be hoisted
out.

In heaven's name, man, cried Stubb, are you ramming home a"
6583	cartridge there?--Avast!  How will that help him; jamming that
6584	"iron-bound bucket on top of his head?  Avast, will ye!

Stand clear of the tackle! cried a voice like the bursting of a
rocket.

Almost in the same instant, with a thunder-boom, the enormous mass
dropped into the sea, like Niagara's Table-Rock into the whirlpool;
the suddenly relieved hull rolled away from it, to far down her
glittering copper; and all caught their breath, as half swinging--now
over the sailors' heads, and now over the water--Daggoo, through a
thick mist of spray, was dimly beheld clinging to the pendulous
tackles, while poor, buried-alive Tashtego was sinking utterly down
to the bottom of the sea!  But hardly had the blinding vapour cleared
away, when a naked figure with a boarding-sword in his hand, was for
one swift moment seen hovering over the bulwarks.  The next, a loud
splash announced that my brave Queequeg had dived to the rescue.  One
packed rush was made to the side, and every eye counted every ripple,
as moment followed moment, and no sign of either the sinker or the
diver could be seen.  Some hands now jumped into a boat alongside,
and pushed a little off from the ship.

Ha! ha! cried Daggoo, all at once, from his now quiet, swinging
perch overhead; and looking further off from the side, we saw an arm
thrust upright from the blue waves; a sight strange to see, as an arm
thrust forth from the grass over a grave.

Both! both!--it is both!--cried Daggoo again with a joyful shout;
and soon after, Queequeg was seen boldly striking out with one hand,
and with the other clutching the long hair of the Indian.  Drawn into
the waiting boat, they were quickly brought to the deck; but Tashtego
was long in coming to, and Queequeg did not look very brisk.

Now, how had this noble rescue been accomplished?  Why, diving after
the slowly descending head, Queequeg with his keen sword had made
side lunges near its bottom, so as to scuttle a large hole there;
then dropping his sword, had thrust his long arm far inwards and
upwards, and so hauled out poor Tash by the head.  He averred, that
upon first thrusting in for him, a leg was presented; but well
knowing that that was not as it ought to be, and might occasion great
trouble;--he had thrust back the leg, and by a dexterous heave and
toss, had wrought a somerset upon the Indian; so that with the next
trial, he came forth in the good old way--head foremost.  As for the
great head itself, that was doing as well as could be expected.

And thus, through the courage and great skill in obstetrics of
Queequeg, the deliverance, or rather, delivery of Tashtego, was
successfully accomplished, in the teeth, too, of the most untoward
and apparently hopeless impediments; which is a lesson by no means to
be forgotten.  Midwifery should be taught in the same course with
fencing and boxing, riding and rowing.

I know that this queer adventure of the Gay-Header's will be sure to
seem incredible to some landsmen, though they themselves may have
either seen or heard of some one's falling into a cistern ashore; an
accident which not seldom happens, and with much less reason too than
the Indian's, considering the exceeding slipperiness of the curb of
the Sperm Whale's well.

But, peradventure, it may be sagaciously urged, how is this?  We
thought the tissued, infiltrated head of the Sperm Whale, was the
lightest and most corky part about him; and yet thou makest it sink
in an element of a far greater specific gravity than itself.  We have
thee there.  Not at all, but I have ye; for at the time poor Tash
fell in, the case had been nearly emptied of its lighter contents,
leaving little but the dense tendinous wall of the well--a double
welded, hammered substance, as I have before said, much heavier than
the sea water, and a lump of which sinks in it like lead almost.  But
the tendency to rapid sinking in this substance was in the present
instance materially counteracted by the other parts of the head
remaining undetached from it, so that it sank very slowly and
deliberately indeed, affording Queequeg a fair chance for performing
his agile obstetrics on the run, as you may say.  Yes, it was a
running delivery, so it was.

Now, had Tashtego perished in that head, it had been a very precious
perishing; smothered in the very whitest and daintiest of fragrant
spermaceti; coffined, hearsed, and tombed in the secret inner chamber
and sanctum sanctorum of the whale.  Only one sweeter end can readily
be recalled--the delicious death of an Ohio honey-hunter, who seeking
honey in the crotch of a hollow tree, found such exceeding store of
it, that leaning too far over, it sucked him in, so that he died
embalmed.  How many, think ye, have likewise fallen into Plato's
honey head, and sweetly perished there?



CHAPTER 79

The Prairie.


To scan the lines of his face, or feel the bumps on the head of this
Leviathan; this is a thing which no Physiognomist or Phrenologist has
as yet undertaken.  Such an enterprise would seem almost as hopeful
as for Lavater to have scrutinized the wrinkles on the Rock of
Gibraltar, or for Gall to have mounted a ladder and manipulated the
Dome of the Pantheon.  Still, in that famous work of his, Lavater
not only treats of the various faces of men, but also attentively
studies the faces of horses, birds, serpents, and fish; and dwells in
detail upon the modifications of expression discernible therein.  Nor
have Gall and his disciple Spurzheim failed to throw out some hints
touching the phrenological characteristics of other beings than man.
Therefore, though I am but ill qualified for a pioneer, in the
application of these two semi-sciences to the whale, I will do my
endeavor.  I try all things; I achieve what I can.

Physiognomically regarded, the Sperm Whale is an anomalous creature.
He has no proper nose.  And since the nose is the central and most
conspicuous of the features; and since it perhaps most modifies and
finally controls their combined expression; hence it would seem that
its entire absence, as an external appendage, must very largely
affect the countenance of the whale.  For as in landscape gardening,
a spire, cupola, monument, or tower of some sort, is deemed almost
indispensable to the completion of the scene; so no face can be
physiognomically in keeping without the elevated open-work belfry of
the nose.  Dash the nose from Phidias's marble Jove, and what a sorry
remainder!  Nevertheless, Leviathan is of so mighty a magnitude, all
his proportions are so stately, that the same deficiency which in the
sculptured Jove were hideous, in him is no blemish at all.  Nay, it
is an added grandeur.  A nose to the whale would have been
impertinent.  As on your physiognomical voyage you sail round his
vast head in your jolly-boat, your noble conceptions of him are never
insulted by the reflection that he has a nose to be pulled.  A
pestilent conceit, which so often will insist upon obtruding even
when beholding the mightiest royal beadle on his throne.

In some particulars, perhaps the most imposing physiognomical view
to be had of the Sperm Whale, is that of the full front of his head.
This aspect is sublime.

In thought, a fine human brow is like the East when troubled with
the morning.  In the repose of the pasture, the curled brow of the
bull has a touch of the grand in it.  Pushing heavy cannon up
mountain defiles, the elephant's brow is majestic.  Human or animal,
the mystical brow is as that great golden seal affixed by the German
Emperors to their decrees.  It signifies--God: done this day by my"
6585	"hand.  But in most creatures, nay in man himself, very often the
brow is but a mere strip of alpine land lying along the snow line.
Few are the foreheads which like Shakespeare's or Melancthon's rise
so high, and descend so low, that the eyes themselves seem clear,
eternal, tideless mountain lakes; and all above them in the forehead's
wrinkles, you seem to track the antlered thoughts descending there to
drink, as the Highland hunters track the snow prints of the deer.
But in the great Sperm Whale, this high and mighty god-like dignity
inherent in the brow is so immensely amplified, that gazing on it, in
that full front view, you feel the Deity and the dread powers more
forcibly than in beholding any other object in living nature.  For
you see no one point precisely; not one distinct feature is revealed;
no nose, eyes, ears, or mouth; no face; he has none, proper; nothing
but that one broad firmament of a forehead, pleated with riddles;
dumbly lowering with the doom of boats, and ships, and men.  Nor, in
profile, does this wondrous brow diminish; though that way viewed its
grandeur does not domineer upon you so.  In profile, you plainly
perceive that horizontal, semi-crescentic depression in the
forehead's middle, which, in man, is Lavater's mark of genius.

But how?  Genius in the Sperm Whale?  Has the Sperm Whale ever
written a book, spoken a speech?  No, his great genius is declared in
his doing nothing particular to prove it.  It is moreover declared in
his pyramidical silence.  And this reminds me that had the great
Sperm Whale been known to the young Orient World, he would have been
deified by their child-magian thoughts.  They deified the crocodile
of the Nile, because the crocodile is tongueless; and the Sperm Whale
has no tongue, or at least it is so exceedingly small, as to be
incapable of protrusion.  If hereafter any highly cultured, poetical
nation shall lure back to their birth-right, the merry May-day gods
of old; and livingly enthrone them again in the now egotistical sky;
in the now unhaunted hill; then be sure, exalted to Jove's high seat,
the great Sperm Whale shall lord it.

Champollion deciphered the wrinkled granite hieroglyphics.  But there
is no Champollion to decipher the Egypt of every man's and every
being's face.  Physiognomy, like every other human science, is but a
passing fable.  If then, Sir William Jones, who read in thirty
languages, could not read the simplest peasant's face in its
profounder and more subtle meanings, how may unlettered Ishmael hope
to read the awful Chaldee of the Sperm Whale's brow?  I but put that
brow before you.  Read it if you can.



CHAPTER 80

The Nut.


If the Sperm Whale be physiognomically a Sphinx, to the phrenologist
his brain seems that geometrical circle which it is impossible to
square.

In the full-grown creature the skull will measure at least twenty
feet in length.  Unhinge the lower jaw, and the side view of this
skull is as the side of a moderately inclined plane resting
throughout on a level base.  But in life--as we have elsewhere
seen--this inclined plane is angularly filled up, and almost squared
by the enormous superincumbent mass of the junk and sperm.  At the
high end the skull forms a crater to bed that part of the mass; while
under the long floor of this crater--in another cavity seldom
exceeding ten inches in length and as many in depth--reposes the
mere handful of this monster's brain.  The brain is at least twenty
feet from his apparent forehead in life; it is hidden away behind its
vast outworks, like the innermost citadel within the amplified
fortifications of Quebec.  So like a choice casket is it secreted in
him, that I have known some whalemen who peremptorily deny that the
Sperm Whale has any other brain than that palpable semblance of one
formed by the cubic-yards of his sperm magazine.  Lying in strange
folds, courses, and convolutions, to their apprehensions, it seems
more in keeping with the idea of his general might to regard that
mystic part of him as the seat of his intelligence.

It is plain, then, that phrenologically the head of this Leviathan,
in the creature's living intact state, is an entire delusion.  As for
his true brain, you can then see no indications of it, nor feel any.
The whale, like all things that are mighty, wears a false brow to the
common world.

If you unload his skull of its spermy heaps and then take a rear view
of its rear end, which is the high end, you will be struck by its
resemblance to the human skull, beheld in the same situation, and
from the same point of view.  Indeed, place this reversed skull
(scaled down to the human magnitude) among a plate of men's skulls,
and you would involuntarily confound it with them; and remarking the
depressions on one part of its summit, in phrenological phrase you
would say--This man had no self-esteem, and no veneration.  And by
those negations, considered along with the affirmative fact of his
prodigious bulk and power, you can best form to yourself the truest,
though not the most exhilarating conception of what the most exalted
potency is.

But if from the comparative dimensions of the whale's proper brain,
you deem it incapable of being adequately charted, then I have
another idea for you.  If you attentively regard almost any
quadruped's spine, you will be struck with the resemblance of its
vertebrae to a strung necklace of dwarfed skulls, all bearing
rudimental resemblance to the skull proper.  It is a German conceit,
that the vertebrae are absolutely undeveloped skulls.  But the
curious external resemblance, I take it the Germans were not the
first men to perceive.  A foreign friend once pointed it out to me,
in the skeleton of a foe he had slain, and with the vertebrae of
which he was inlaying, in a sort of basso-relievo, the beaked prow
of his canoe.  Now, I consider that the phrenologists have omitted an
important thing in not pushing their investigations from the
cerebellum through the spinal canal.  For I believe that much of a
man's character will be found betokened in his backbone.  I would
rather feel your spine than your skull, whoever you are.  A thin
joist of a spine never yet upheld a full and noble soul.  I rejoice
in my spine, as in the firm audacious staff of that flag which I
fling half out to the world.

Apply this spinal branch of phrenology to the Sperm Whale.  His
cranial cavity is continuous with the first neck-vertebra; and in
that vertebra the bottom of the spinal canal will measure ten inches
across, being eight in height, and of a triangular figure with the
base downwards.  As it passes through the remaining vertebrae the
canal tapers in size, but for a considerable distance remains of
large capacity.  Now, of course, this canal is filled with much the
same strangely fibrous substance--the spinal cord--as the brain; and
directly communicates with the brain.  And what is still more, for
many feet after emerging from the brain's cavity, the spinal cord
remains of an undecreasing girth, almost equal to that of the brain.
Under all these circumstances, would it be unreasonable to survey and
map out the whale's spine phrenologically?  For, viewed in this
light, the wonderful comparative smallness of his brain proper is
more than compensated by the wonderful comparative magnitude of his
spinal cord.

But leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phrenologists, I
would merely assume the spinal theory for a moment, in reference to
the Sperm Whale's hump.  This august hump, if I mistake not, rises
over one of the larger vertebrae, and is, therefore, in some sort,
the outer convex mould of it.  From its relative situation then, I
should call this high hump the organ of firmness or indomitableness
in the Sperm Whale.  And that the great monster is indomitable, you
will yet have reason to know.



CHAPTER 81

The Pequod Meets The Virgin.


The predestinated day arrived, and we duly met the ship Jungfrau,
Derick De Deer, master, of Bremen.

At one time the greatest whaling people in the world, the Dutch and
Germans are now among the least; but here and there at very wide
intervals of latitude and longitude, you still occasionally meet with
their flag in the Pacific.

For some reason, the Jungfrau seemed quite eager to pay her respects.
While yet some distance from the Pequod, she rounded to, and
dropping a boat, her captain was impelled towards us, impatiently
standing in the bows instead of the stern.

What has he in his hand there? cried Starbuck, pointing to
something wavingly held by the German.  Impossible!--a lamp-feeder!

Not that, said Stubb, no, no, it's a coffee-pot, Mr. Starbuck;"
6586	he's coming off to make us our coffee, is the Yarman; don't you see
6587	that big tin can there alongside of him?--that's his boiling water.
6588	"Oh! he's all right, is the Yarman.

Go along with you, cried Flask, it's a lamp-feeder and an oil-can."
6589	"He's out of oil, and has come a-begging.

However curious it may seem for an oil-ship to be borrowing oil on
the whale-ground, and however much it may invertedly contradict the
old proverb about carrying coals to Newcastle, yet sometimes such a
thing really happens; and in the present case Captain Derick De Deer
did indubitably conduct a lamp-feeder as Flask did declare.

As he mounted the deck, Ahab abruptly accosted him, without at all
heeding what he had in his hand; but in his broken lingo, the German
soon evinced his complete ignorance of the White Whale; immediately
turning the conversation to his lamp-feeder and oil can, with some
remarks touching his having to turn into his hammock at night in
profound darkness--his last drop of Bremen oil being gone, and not a
single flying-fish yet captured to supply the deficiency; concluding
by hinting that his ship was indeed what in the Fishery is
technically called a CLEAN one (that is, an empty one), well
deserving the name of Jungfrau or the Virgin.

His necessities supplied, Derick departed; but he had not gained his
ship's side, when whales were almost simultaneously raised from the
mast-heads of both vessels; and so eager for the chase was Derick,
that without pausing to put his oil-can and lamp-feeder aboard, he
slewed round his boat and made after the leviathan lamp-feeders.

Now, the game having risen to leeward, he and the other three German
boats that soon followed him, had considerably the start of the
Pequod's keels.  There were eight whales, an average pod.  Aware of
their danger, they were going all abreast with great speed straight
before the wind, rubbing their flanks as closely as so many spans of
horses in harness.  They left a great, wide wake, as though
continually unrolling a great wide parchment upon the sea.

Full in this rapid wake, and many fathoms in the rear, swam a huge,
humped old bull, which by his comparatively slow progress, as well as
by the unusual yellowish incrustations overgrowing him, seemed
afflicted with the jaundice, or some other infirmity.  Whether this
whale belonged to the pod in advance, seemed questionable; for it is
not customary for such venerable leviathans to be at all social.
Nevertheless, he stuck to their wake, though indeed their back water
must have retarded him, because the white-bone or swell at his broad
muzzle was a dashed one, like the swell formed when two hostile
currents meet.  His spout was short, slow, and laborious; coming
forth with a choking sort of gush, and spending itself in torn
shreds, followed by strange subterranean commotions in him, which
seemed to have egress at his other buried extremity, causing the
waters behind him to upbubble.

Who's got some paregoric? said Stubb, he has the stomach-ache, I'm"
6590	afraid.  Lord, think of having half an acre of stomach-ache!  Adverse
6591	winds are holding mad Christmas in him, boys.  It's the first foul
6592	wind I ever knew to blow from astern; but look, did ever whale yaw
6593	"so before? it must be, he's lost his tiller.

As an overladen Indiaman bearing down the Hindostan coast with a deck
load of frightened horses, careens, buries, rolls, and wallows on her
way; so did this old whale heave his aged bulk, and now and then
partly turning over on his cumbrous rib-ends, expose the cause of his
devious wake in the unnatural stump of his starboard fin.  Whether he
had lost that fin in battle, or had been born without it, it were
hard to say.

Only wait a bit, old chap, and I'll give ye a sling for that wounded"
6594	"arm, cried cruel Flask, pointing to the whale-line near him.

Mind he don't sling thee with it, cried Starbuck.  Give way, or"
6595	"the German will have him.

With one intent all the combined rival boats were pointed for this
one fish, because not only was he the largest, and therefore the most
valuable whale, but he was nearest to them, and the other whales were
going with such great velocity, moreover, as almost to defy pursuit
for the time.  At this juncture the Pequod's keels had shot by the
three German boats last lowered; but from the great start he had had,
Derick's boat still led the chase, though every moment neared by his
foreign rivals.  The only thing they feared, was, that from being
already so nigh to his mark, he would be enabled to dart his iron
before they could completely overtake and pass him.  As for Derick,
he seemed quite confident that this would be the case, and
occasionally with a deriding gesture shook his lamp-feeder at the
other boats.

The ungracious and ungrateful dog! cried Starbuck; he mocks and"
6596	dares me with the very poor-box I filled for him not five minutes
6597	ago!--then in his old intense whisper--Give way, greyhounds!  Dog
6598	"to it!

I tell ye what it is, men--cried Stubb to his crew--it's against"
6599	my religion to get mad; but I'd like to eat that villainous
6600	Yarman--Pull--won't ye?  Are ye going to let that rascal beat ye?  Do
6601	ye love brandy?  A hogshead of brandy, then, to the best man.  Come,
6602	why don't some of ye burst a blood-vessel?  Who's that been dropping
6603	an anchor overboard--we don't budge an inch--we're becalmed.  Halloo,
6604	here's grass growing in the boat's bottom--and by the Lord, the mast
6605	there's budding.  This won't do, boys.  Look at that Yarman!  The
6606	"short and long of it is, men, will ye spit fire or not?

Oh! see the suds he makes! cried Flask, dancing up and down--What"
6607	a hump--Oh, DO pile on the beef--lays like a log!  Oh! my lads, DO
6608	spring--slap-jacks and quahogs for supper, you know, my lads--baked
6609	clams and muffins--oh, DO, DO, spring,--he's a hundred barreller--don't
6610	lose him now--don't oh, DON'T!--see that Yarman--Oh,
6611	won't ye pull for your duff, my lads--such a sog! such a sogger!
6612	Don't ye love sperm?  There goes three thousand dollars, men!--a
6613	bank!--a whole bank!  The bank of England!--Oh, DO, DO, DO!--What's
6614	"that Yarman about now?

At this moment Derick was in the act of pitching his lamp-feeder at
the advancing boats, and also his oil-can; perhaps with the double
view of retarding his rivals' way, and at the same time economically
accelerating his own by the momentary impetus of the backward toss.

The unmannerly Dutch dogger! cried Stubb.  Pull now, men, like"
6615	fifty thousand line-of-battle-ship loads of red-haired devils.  What
6616	d'ye say, Tashtego; are you the man to snap your spine in
6617	"two-and-twenty pieces for the honour of old Gayhead?  What d'ye say?

I say, pull like god-dam,--cried the Indian.

Fiercely, but evenly incited by the taunts of the German, the
Pequod's three boats now began ranging almost abreast; and, so
disposed, momentarily neared him.  In that fine, loose, chivalrous
attitude of the headsman when drawing near to his prey, the three
mates stood up proudly, occasionally backing the after oarsman with
an exhilarating cry of, There she slides, now!  Hurrah for the"
6618	"white-ash breeze!  Down with the Yarman!  Sail over him!

But so decided an original start had Derick had, that spite of all
their gallantry, he would have proved the victor in this race, had
not a righteous judgment descended upon him in a crab which caught
the blade of his midship oarsman.  While this clumsy lubber was
striving to free his white-ash, and while, in consequence, Derick's
boat was nigh to capsizing, and he thundering away at his men in a
mighty rage;--that was a good time for Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask.
With a shout, they took a mortal start forwards, and slantingly
ranged up on the German's quarter.  An instant more, and all four
boats were diagonically in the whale's immediate wake, while
stretching from them, on both sides, was the foaming swell that he
made.

It was a terrific, most pitiable, and maddening sight.  The whale was
now going head out, and sending his spout before him in a continual
tormented jet; while his one poor fin beat his side in an agony of
fright.  Now to this hand, now to that, he yawed in his faltering
flight, and still at every billow that he broke, he spasmodically
sank in the sea, or sideways rolled towards the sky his one beating
fin.  So have I seen a bird with clipped wing making affrighted
broken circles in the air, vainly striving to escape the piratical
hawks.  But the bird has a voice, and with plaintive cries will make
known her fear; but the fear of this vast dumb brute of the sea, was
chained up and enchanted in him; he had no voice, save that choking
respiration through his spiracle, and this made the sight of him
unspeakably pitiable; while still, in his amazing bulk, portcullis
jaw, and omnipotent tail, there was enough to appal the stoutest man
who so pitied.

Seeing now that but a very few moments more would give the Pequod's
boats the advantage, and rather than be thus foiled of his game,
Derick chose to hazard what to him must have seemed a most unusually
long dart, ere the last chance would for ever escape.

But no sooner did his harpooneer stand up for the stroke, than all
three tigers--Queequeg, Tashtego, Daggoo--instinctively sprang to
their feet, and standing in a diagonal row, simultaneously pointed
their barbs; and darted over the head of the German harpooneer, their
three Nantucket irons entered the whale.  Blinding vapours of foam and
white-fire!  The three boats, in the first fury of the whale's
headlong rush, bumped the German's aside with such force, that both
Derick and his baffled harpooneer were spilled out, and sailed over
by the three flying keels.

Don't be afraid, my butter-boxes, cried Stubb, casting a passing
glance upon them as he shot by; ye'll be picked up presently--all"
6619	right--I saw some sharks astern--St. Bernard's dogs, you
6620	know--relieve distressed travellers.  Hurrah! this is the way to sail
6621	now.  Every keel a sunbeam!  Hurrah!--Here we go like three tin
6622	kettles at the tail of a mad cougar!  This puts me in mind of
6623	fastening to an elephant in a tilbury on a plain--makes the
6624	wheel-spokes fly, boys, when you fasten to him that way; and there's
6625	danger of being pitched out too, when you strike a hill.  Hurrah!
6626	this is the way a fellow feels when he's going to Davy Jones--all a
6627	rush down an endless inclined plane!  Hurrah! this whale carries the
6628	"everlasting mail!

But the monster's run was a brief one.  Giving a sudden gasp, he
tumultuously sounded.  With a grating rush, the three lines flew
round the loggerheads with such a force as to gouge deep grooves in
them; while so fearful were the harpooneers that this rapid sounding
would soon exhaust the lines, that using all their dexterous might,
they caught repeated smoking turns with the rope to hold on; till at
last--owing to the perpendicular strain from the lead-lined chocks of
the boats, whence the three ropes went straight down into the
blue--the gunwales of the bows were almost even with the water, while
the three sterns tilted high in the air.  And the whale soon ceasing
to sound, for some time they remained in that attitude, fearful of
expending more line, though the position was a little ticklish.  But
though boats have been taken down and lost in this way, yet it is
this holding on, as it is called; this hooking up by the sharp
barbs of his live flesh from the back; this it is that often torments
the Leviathan into soon rising again to meet the sharp lance of his
foes.  Yet not to speak of the peril of the thing, it is to be
doubted whether this course is always the best; for it is but
reasonable to presume, that the longer the stricken whale stays under
water, the more he is exhausted.  Because, owing to the enormous
surface of him--in a full grown sperm whale something less than 2000
square feet--the pressure of the water is immense.  We all know what
an astonishing atmospheric weight we ourselves stand up under; even
here, above-ground, in the air; how vast, then, the burden of a
whale, bearing on his back a column of two hundred fathoms of ocean!
It must at least equal the weight of fifty atmospheres.  One whaleman
has estimated it at the weight of twenty line-of-battle ships, with
all their guns, and stores, and men on board.

As the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea, gazing down
into its eternal blue noon; and as not a single groan or cry of any
sort, nay, not so much as a ripple or a bubble came up from its
depths; what landsman would have thought, that beneath all that
silence and placidity, the utmost monster of the seas was writhing
and wrenching in agony!  Not eight inches of perpendicular rope were
visible at the bows.  Seems it credible that by three such thin
threads the great Leviathan was suspended like the big weight to an
eight day clock.  Suspended? and to what?  To three bits of board.
Is this the creature of whom it was once so triumphantly said--Canst"
6629	thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish-spears?
6630	The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold, the spear, the dart,
6631	nor the habergeon: he esteemeth iron as straw; the arrow cannot make
6632	him flee; darts are counted as stubble; he laugheth at the shaking of
6633	"a spear!  This the creature? this he?  Oh! that unfulfilments should
follow the prophets.  For with the strength of a thousand thighs in
his tail, Leviathan had run his head under the mountains of the sea,
to hide him from the Pequod's fish-spears!

In that sloping afternoon sunlight, the shadows that the three boats
sent down beneath the surface, must have been long enough and broad
enough to shade half Xerxes' army.  Who can tell how appalling to the
wounded whale must have been such huge phantoms flitting over his
head!

Stand by, men; he stirs, cried Starbuck, as the three lines
suddenly vibrated in the water, distinctly conducting upwards to
them, as by magnetic wires, the life and death throbs of the whale,
so that every oarsman felt them in his seat.  The next moment,
relieved in great part from the downward strain at the bows, the
boats gave a sudden bounce upwards, as a small icefield will, when a
dense herd of white bears are scared from it into the sea.

Haul in!  Haul in! cried Starbuck again; he's rising.

The lines, of which, hardly an instant before, not one hand's breadth
could have been gained, were now in long quick coils flung back all
dripping into the boats, and soon the whale broke water within two
ship's lengths of the hunters.

His motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion.  In most land
animals there are certain valves or flood-gates in many of their
veins, whereby when wounded, the blood is in some degree at least
instantly shut off in certain directions.  Not so with the whale; one
of whose peculiarities it is to have an entire non-valvular structure
of the blood-vessels, so that when pierced even by so small a point
as a harpoon, a deadly drain is at once begun upon his whole
arterial system; and when this is heightened by the extraordinary
pressure of water at a great distance below the surface, his life may
be said to pour from him in incessant streams.  Yet so vast is the
quantity of blood in him, and so distant and numerous its interior
fountains, that he will keep thus bleeding and bleeding for a
considerable period; even as in a drought a river will flow, whose
source is in the well-springs of far-off and undiscernible hills.
Even now, when the boats pulled upon this whale, and perilously drew
over his swaying flukes, and the lances were darted into him, they
were followed by steady jets from the new made wound, which kept
continually playing, while the natural spout-hole in his head was
only at intervals, however rapid, sending its affrighted moisture
into the air.  From this last vent no blood yet came, because no
vital part of him had thus far been struck.  His life, as they
significantly call it, was untouched.

As the boats now more closely surrounded him, the whole upper part of
his form, with much of it that is ordinarily submerged, was plainly
revealed.  His eyes, or rather the places where his eyes had been,
were beheld.  As strange misgrown masses gather in the knot-holes of
the noblest oaks when prostrate, so from the points which the whale's
eyes had once occupied, now protruded blind bulbs, horribly pitiable
to see.  But pity there was none.  For all his old age, and his one
arm, and his blind eyes, he must die the death and be murdered, in
order to light the gay bridals and other merry-makings of men, and
also to illuminate the solemn churches that preach unconditional
inoffensiveness by all to all.  Still rolling in his blood, at last
he partially disclosed a strangely discoloured bunch or protuberance,
the size of a bushel, low down on the flank.

A nice spot, cried Flask; just let me prick him there once.

Avast! cried Starbuck, there's no need of that!

But humane Starbuck was too late.  At the instant of the dart an
ulcerous jet shot from this cruel wound, and goaded by it into more
than sufferable anguish, the whale now spouting thick blood, with
swift fury blindly darted at the craft, bespattering them and their
glorying crews all over with showers of gore, capsizing Flask's boat
and marring the bows.  It was his death stroke.  For, by this time,
so spent was he by loss of blood, that he helplessly rolled away from
the wreck he had made; lay panting on his side, impotently flapped
with his stumped fin, then over and over slowly revolved like a
waning world; turned up the white secrets of his belly; lay like a
log, and died.  It was most piteous, that last expiring spout.  As
when by unseen hands the water is gradually drawn off from some
mighty fountain, and with half-stifled melancholy gurglings the
spray-column lowers and lowers to the ground--so the last long dying
spout of the whale.

Soon, while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship, the body
showed symptoms of sinking with all its treasures unrifled.
Immediately, by Starbuck's orders, lines were secured to it at
different points, so that ere long every boat was a buoy; the sunken
whale being suspended a few inches beneath them by the cords.  By
very heedful management, when the ship drew nigh, the whale was
transferred to her side, and was strongly secured there by the
stiffest fluke-chains, for it was plain that unless artificially
upheld, the body would at once sink to the bottom.

It so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the
spade, the entire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in
his flesh, on the lower part of the bunch before described.  But as
the stumps of harpoons are frequently found in the dead bodies of
captured whales, with the flesh perfectly healed around them, and no
prominence of any kind to denote their place; therefore, there must
needs have been some other unknown reason in the present case fully
to account for the ulceration alluded to.  But still more curious was
the fact of a lance-head of stone being found in him, not far from
the buried iron, the flesh perfectly firm about it.  Who had darted
that stone lance?  And when?  It might have been darted by some Nor'
West Indian long before America was discovered.

What other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrous
cabinet there is no telling.  But a sudden stop was put to further
discoveries, by the ship's being unprecedentedly dragged over
sideways to the sea, owing to the body's immensely increasing
tendency to sink.  However, Starbuck, who had the ordering of
affairs, hung on to it to the last; hung on to it so resolutely,
indeed, that when at length the ship would have been capsized, if
still persisting in locking arms with the body; then, when the
command was given to break clear from it, such was the immovable
strain upon the timber-heads to which the fluke-chains and cables
were fastened, that it was impossible to cast them off.  Meantime
everything in the Pequod was aslant.  To cross to the other side of
the deck was like walking up the steep gabled roof of a house.  The
ship groaned and gasped.  Many of the ivory inlayings of her bulwarks
and cabins were started from their places, by the unnatural
dislocation.  In vain handspikes and crows were brought to bear upon
the immovable fluke-chains, to pry them adrift from the timberheads;
and so low had the whale now settled that the submerged ends could
not be at all approached, while every moment whole tons of
ponderosity seemed added to the sinking bulk, and the ship seemed on
the point of going over.

Hold on, hold on, won't ye? cried Stubb to the body, don't be in"
6634	such a devil of a hurry to sink!  By thunder, men, we must do
6635	something or go for it.  No use prying there; avast, I say with your
6636	handspikes, and run one of ye for a prayer book and a pen-knife, and
6637	"cut the big chains.

Knife?  Aye, aye, cried Queequeg, and seizing the carpenter's heavy
hatchet, he leaned out of a porthole, and steel to iron, began
slashing at the largest fluke-chains.  But a few strokes, full of
sparks, were given, when the exceeding strain effected the rest.
With a terrific snap, every fastening went adrift; the ship righted,
the carcase sank.

Now, this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed Sperm
Whale is a very curious thing; nor has any fisherman yet adequately
accounted for it.  Usually the dead Sperm Whale floats with great
buoyancy, with its side or belly considerably elevated above the
surface.  If the only whales that thus sank were old, meagre, and
broken-hearted creatures, their pads of lard diminished and all their
bones heavy and rheumatic; then you might with some reason assert
that this sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gravity in the
fish so sinking, consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in
him.  But it is not so.  For young whales, in the highest health, and
swelling with noble aspirations, prematurely cut off in the warm
flush and May of life, with all their panting lard about them; even
these brawny, buoyant heroes do sometimes sink.

Be it said, however, that the Sperm Whale is far less liable to this
accident than any other species.  Where one of that sort go down,
twenty Right Whales do.  This difference in the species is no doubt
imputable in no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the
Right Whale; his Venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a
ton; from this incumbrance the Sperm Whale is wholly free.  But there
are instances where, after the lapse of many hours or several days,
the sunken whale again rises, more buoyant than in life.  But the
reason of this is obvious.  Gases are generated in him; he swells to
a prodigious magnitude; becomes a sort of animal balloon.  A
line-of-battle ship could hardly keep him under then.  In the Shore
Whaling, on soundings, among the Bays of New Zealand, when a Right
Whale gives token of sinking, they fasten buoys to him, with plenty
of rope; so that when the body has gone down, they know where to look
for it when it shall have ascended again.

It was not long after the sinking of the body that a cry was heard
from the Pequod's mast-heads, announcing that the Jungfrau was again
lowering her boats; though the only spout in sight was that of a
Fin-Back, belonging to the species of uncapturable whales, because of
its incredible power of swimming.  Nevertheless, the Fin-Back's spout
is so similar to the Sperm Whale's, that by unskilful fishermen it is
often mistaken for it.  And consequently Derick and all his host were
now in valiant chase of this unnearable brute.  The Virgin crowding
all sail, made after her four young keels, and thus they all
disappeared far to leeward, still in bold, hopeful chase.

Oh! many are the Fin-Backs, and many are the Dericks, my friend.



CHAPTER 82

The Honour and Glory of Whaling.


There are some enterprises in which a careful disorderliness is the
true method.

The more I dive into this matter of whaling, and push my researches
up to the very spring-head of it so much the more am I impressed with
its great honourableness and antiquity; and especially when I find so
many great demi-gods and heroes, prophets of all sorts, who one way
or other have shed distinction upon it, I am transported with the
reflection that I myself belong, though but subordinately, to so
emblazoned a fraternity.

The gallant Perseus, a son of Jupiter, was the first whaleman; and to
the eternal honour of our calling be it said, that the first whale
attacked by our brotherhood was not killed with any sordid intent.
Those were the knightly days of our profession, when we only bore
arms to succor the distressed, and not to fill men's lamp-feeders.
Every one knows the fine story of Perseus and Andromeda; how the
lovely Andromeda, the daughter of a king, was tied to a rock on the
sea-coast, and as Leviathan was in the very act of carrying her off,
Perseus, the prince of whalemen, intrepidly advancing, harpooned the
monster, and delivered and married the maid.  It was an admirable
artistic exploit, rarely achieved by the best harpooneers of the
present day; inasmuch as this Leviathan was slain at the very first
dart.  And let no man doubt this Arkite story; for in the ancient
Joppa, now Jaffa, on the Syrian coast, in one of the Pagan temples,
there stood for many ages the vast skeleton of a whale, which the
city's legends and all the inhabitants asserted to be the identical
bones of the monster that Perseus slew.  When the Romans took Joppa,
the same skeleton was carried to Italy in triumph.  What seems most
singular and suggestively important in this story, is this: it was
from Joppa that Jonah set sail.

Akin to the adventure of Perseus and Andromeda--indeed, by some
supposed to be indirectly derived from it--is that famous story of
St. George and the Dragon; which dragon I maintain to have been a
whale; for in many old chronicles whales and dragons are strangely
jumbled together, and often stand for each other.  Thou art as a"
6638	"lion of the waters, and as a dragon of the sea, saith Ezekiel;
hereby, plainly meaning a whale; in truth, some versions of the Bible
use that word itself.  Besides, it would much subtract from the glory
of the exploit had St. George but encountered a crawling reptile of
the land, instead of doing battle with the great monster of the deep.
Any man may kill a snake, but only a Perseus, a St. George, a
Coffin, have the heart in them to march boldly up to a whale.

Let not the modern paintings of this scene mislead us; for though the
creature encountered by that valiant whaleman of old is vaguely
represented of a griffin-like shape, and though the battle is
depicted on land and the saint on horseback, yet considering the
great ignorance of those times, when the true form of the whale was
unknown to artists; and considering that as in Perseus' case, St.
George's whale might have crawled up out of the sea on the beach; and
considering that the animal ridden by St. George might have been only
a large seal, or sea-horse; bearing all this in mind, it will not
appear altogether incompatible with the sacred legend and the
ancientest draughts of the scene, to hold this so-called dragon no
other than the great Leviathan himself.  In fact, placed before the
strict and piercing truth, this whole story will fare like that fish,
flesh, and fowl idol of the Philistines, Dagon by name; who being
planted before the ark of Israel, his horse's head and both the palms
of his hands fell off from him, and only the stump or fishy part of
him remained.  Thus, then, one of our own noble stamp, even a
whaleman, is the tutelary guardian of England; and by good rights, we
harpooneers of Nantucket should be enrolled in the most noble order
of St. George.  And therefore, let not the knights of that honourable
company (none of whom, I venture to say, have ever had to do with a
whale like their great patron), let them never eye a Nantucketer with
disdain, since even in our woollen frocks and tarred trowsers we are
much better entitled to St. George's decoration than they.

Whether to admit Hercules among us or not, concerning this I long
remained dubious: for though according to the Greek mythologies, that
antique Crockett and Kit Carson--that brawny doer of rejoicing good
deeds, was swallowed down and thrown up by a whale; still, whether
that strictly makes a whaleman of him, that might be mooted.  It
nowhere appears that he ever actually harpooned his fish, unless,
indeed, from the inside.  Nevertheless, he may be deemed a sort of
involuntary whaleman; at any rate the whale caught him, if he did not
the whale.  I claim him for one of our clan.

But, by the best contradictory authorities, this Grecian story of
Hercules and the whale is considered to be derived from the still
more ancient Hebrew story of Jonah and the whale; and vice versa;
certainly they are very similar.  If I claim the demigod then, why
not the prophet?

Nor do heroes, saints, demigods, and prophets alone comprise the
whole roll of our order.  Our grand master is still to be named; for
like royal kings of old times, we find the head waters of our
fraternity in nothing short of the great gods themselves.  That
wondrous oriental story is now to be rehearsed from the Shaster,
which gives us the dread Vishnoo, one of the three persons in the
godhead of the Hindoos; gives us this divine Vishnoo himself for our
Lord;--Vishnoo, who, by the first of his ten earthly incarnations,
has for ever set apart and sanctified the whale.  When Brahma, or the
God of Gods, saith the Shaster, resolved to recreate the world after
one of its periodical dissolutions, he gave birth to Vishnoo, to
preside over the work; but the Vedas, or mystical books, whose
perusal would seem to have been indispensable to Vishnoo before
beginning the creation, and which therefore must have contained
something in the shape of practical hints to young architects, these
Vedas were lying at the bottom of the waters; so Vishnoo became
incarnate in a whale, and sounding down in him to the uttermost
depths, rescued the sacred volumes.  Was not this Vishnoo a whaleman,
then? even as a man who rides a horse is called a horseman?

Perseus, St. George, Hercules, Jonah, and Vishnoo! there's a
member-roll for you!  What club but the whaleman's can head off like
that?



CHAPTER 83

Jonah Historically Regarded.


Reference was made to the historical story of Jonah and the whale in
the preceding chapter.  Now some Nantucketers rather distrust this
historical story of Jonah and the whale.  But then there were some
sceptical Greeks and Romans, who, standing out from the orthodox
pagans of their times, equally doubted the story of Hercules and the
whale, and Arion and the dolphin; and yet their doubting those
traditions did not make those traditions one whit the less facts, for
all that.

One old Sag-Harbor whaleman's chief reason for questioning the Hebrew
story was this:--He had one of those quaint old-fashioned Bibles,
embellished with curious, unscientific plates; one of which
represented Jonah's whale with two spouts in his head--a peculiarity
only true with respect to a species of the Leviathan (the Right
Whale, and the varieties of that order), concerning which the
fishermen have this saying, A penny roll would choke him; his
swallow is so very small.  But, to this, Bishop Jebb's anticipative
answer is ready.  It is not necessary, hints the Bishop, that we
consider Jonah as tombed in the whale's belly, but as temporarily
lodged in some part of his mouth.  And this seems reasonable enough
in the good Bishop.  For truly, the Right Whale's mouth would
accommodate a couple of whist-tables, and comfortably seat all the
players.  Possibly, too, Jonah might have ensconced himself in a
hollow tooth; but, on second thoughts, the Right Whale is toothless.

Another reason which Sag-Harbor (he went by that name) urged for his
want of faith in this matter of the prophet, was something obscurely
in reference to his incarcerated body and the whale's gastric juices.
But this objection likewise falls to the ground, because a German
exegetist supposes that Jonah must have taken refuge in the floating
body of a DEAD whale--even as the French soldiers in the Russian
campaign turned their dead horses into tents, and crawled into them.
Besides, it has been divined by other continental commentators, that
when Jonah was thrown overboard from the Joppa ship, he straightway
effected his escape to another vessel near by, some vessel with a
whale for a figure-head; and, I would add, possibly called The"
6639	"Whale, as some craft are nowadays christened the Shark, the
Gull, the Eagle.  Nor have there been wanting learned exegetists
who have opined that the whale mentioned in the book of Jonah merely
meant a life-preserver--an inflated bag of wind--which the endangered
prophet swam to, and so was saved from a watery doom.  Poor
Sag-Harbor, therefore, seems worsted all round.  But he had still
another reason for his want of faith.  It was this, if I remember
right: Jonah was swallowed by the whale in the Mediterranean Sea, and
after three days he was vomited up somewhere within three days'
journey of Nineveh, a city on the Tigris, very much more than three
days' journey across from the nearest point of the Mediterranean
coast.  How is that?

But was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within
that short distance of Nineveh?  Yes.  He might have carried him
round by the way of the Cape of Good Hope.  But not to speak of the
passage through the whole length of the Mediterranean, and another
passage up the Persian Gulf and Red Sea, such a supposition would
involve the complete circumnavigation of all Africa in three days,
not to speak of the Tigris waters, near the site of Nineveh, being
too shallow for any whale to swim in.  Besides, this idea of Jonah's
weathering the Cape of Good Hope at so early a day would wrest the
honour of the discovery of that great headland from Bartholomew Diaz,
its reputed discoverer, and so make modern history a liar.

But all these foolish arguments of old Sag-Harbor only evinced his
foolish pride of reason--a thing still more reprehensible in him,
seeing that he had but little learning except what he had picked up
from the sun and the sea.  I say it only shows his foolish, impious
pride, and abominable, devilish rebellion against the reverend
clergy.  For by a Portuguese Catholic priest, this very idea of
Jonah's going to Nineveh via the Cape of Good Hope was advanced as a
signal magnification of the general miracle.  And so it was.
Besides, to this day, the highly enlightened Turks devoutly believe
in the historical story of Jonah.  And some three centuries ago, an
English traveller in old Harris's Voyages, speaks of a Turkish Mosque
built in honour of Jonah, in which Mosque was a miraculous lamp that
burnt without any oil.



CHAPTER 84

Pitchpoling.


To make them run easily and swiftly, the axles of carriages are
anointed; and for much the same purpose, some whalers perform an
analogous operation upon their boat; they grease the bottom.  Nor is
it to be doubted that as such a procedure can do no harm, it may
possibly be of no contemptible advantage; considering that oil and
water are hostile; that oil is a sliding thing, and that the object
in view is to make the boat slide bravely.  Queequeg believed
strongly in anointing his boat, and one morning not long after the
German ship Jungfrau disappeared, took more than customary pains in
that occupation; crawling under its bottom, where it hung over the
side, and rubbing in the unctuousness as though diligently seeking to
insure a crop of hair from the craft's bald keel.  He seemed to be
working in obedience to some particular presentiment.  Nor did it
remain unwarranted by the event.

Towards noon whales were raised; but so soon as the ship sailed down
to them, they turned and fled with swift precipitancy; a disordered
flight, as of Cleopatra's barges from Actium.

Nevertheless, the boats pursued, and Stubb's was foremost.  By great
exertion, Tashtego at last succeeded in planting one iron; but the
stricken whale, without at all sounding, still continued his
horizontal flight, with added fleetness.  Such unintermitted
strainings upon the planted iron must sooner or later inevitably
extract it.  It became imperative to lance the flying whale, or be
content to lose him.  But to haul the boat up to his flank was
impossible, he swam so fast and furious.  What then remained?

Of all the wondrous devices and dexterities, the sleights of hand and
countless subtleties, to which the veteran whaleman is so often
forced, none exceed that fine manoeuvre with the lance called
pitchpoling.  Small sword, or broad sword, in all its exercises
boasts nothing like it.  It is only indispensable with an inveterate
running whale; its grand fact and feature is the wonderful distance
to which the long lance is accurately darted from a violently
rocking, jerking boat, under extreme headway.  Steel and wood
included, the entire spear is some ten or twelve feet in length; the
staff is much slighter than that of the harpoon, and also of a
lighter material--pine.  It is furnished with a small rope called a
warp, of considerable length, by which it can be hauled back to the
hand after darting.

But before going further, it is important to mention here, that
though the harpoon may be pitchpoled in the same way with the lance,
yet it is seldom done; and when done, is still less frequently
successful, on account of the greater weight and inferior length of
the harpoon as compared with the lance, which in effect become
serious drawbacks.  As a general thing, therefore, you must first
get fast to a whale, before any pitchpoling comes into play.

Look now at Stubb; a man who from his humorous, deliberate coolness
and equanimity in the direst emergencies, was specially qualified to
excel in pitchpoling.  Look at him; he stands upright in the tossed
bow of the flying boat; wrapt in fleecy foam, the towing whale is
forty feet ahead.  Handling the long lance lightly, glancing twice or
thrice along its length to see if it be exactly straight, Stubb
whistlingly gathers up the coil of the warp in one hand, so as to
secure its free end in his grasp, leaving the rest unobstructed.
Then holding the lance full before his waistband's middle, he levels
it at the whale; when, covering him with it, he steadily depresses
the butt-end in his hand, thereby elevating the point till the weapon
stands fairly balanced upon his palm, fifteen feet in the air.  He
minds you somewhat of a juggler, balancing a long staff on his chin.
Next moment with a rapid, nameless impulse, in a superb lofty arch the
bright steel spans the foaming distance, and quivers in the life spot
of the whale.  Instead of sparkling water, he now spouts red blood.

That drove the spigot out of him! cried Stubb.  'Tis July's"
6640	immortal Fourth; all fountains must run wine today!  Would now, it
6641	were old Orleans whiskey, or old Ohio, or unspeakable old
6642	Monongahela!  Then, Tashtego, lad, I'd have ye hold a canakin to the
6643	jet, and we'd drink round it!  Yea, verily, hearts alive, we'd brew
6644	choice punch in the spread of his spout-hole there, and from that
6645	"live punch-bowl quaff the living stuff.

Again and again to such gamesome talk, the dexterous dart is
repeated, the spear returning to its master like a greyhound held in
skilful leash.  The agonized whale goes into his flurry; the tow-line
is slackened, and the pitchpoler dropping astern, folds his hands,
and mutely watches the monster die.



CHAPTER 85

The Fountain.


That for six thousand years--and no one knows how many millions of
ages before--the great whales should have been spouting all over the
sea, and sprinkling and mistifying the gardens of the deep, as with
so many sprinkling or mistifying pots; and that for some centuries
back, thousands of hunters should have been close by the fountain of
the whale, watching these sprinklings and spoutings--that all this
should be, and yet, that down to this blessed minute (fifteen and a
quarter minutes past one o'clock P.M. of this sixteenth day of
December, A.D. 1851), it should still remain a problem, whether these
spoutings are, after all, really water, or nothing but vapour--this is
surely a noteworthy thing.

Let us, then, look at this matter, along with some interesting items
contingent.  Every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their
gills, the finny tribes in general breathe the air which at all times
is combined with the element in which they swim; hence, a herring or
a cod might live a century, and never once raise its head above the
surface.  But owing to his marked internal structure which gives him
regular lungs, like a human being's, the whale can only live by
inhaling the disengaged air in the open atmosphere.  Wherefore the
necessity for his periodical visits to the upper world.  But he
cannot in any degree breathe through his mouth, for, in his ordinary
attitude, the Sperm Whale's mouth is buried at least eight feet
beneath the surface; and what is still more, his windpipe has no
connexion with his mouth.  No, he breathes through his spiracle
alone; and this is on the top of his head.

If I say, that in any creature breathing is only a function
indispensable to vitality, inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a
certain element, which being subsequently brought into contact with
the blood imparts to the blood its vivifying principle, I do not
think I shall err; though I may possibly use some superfluous
scientific words.  Assume it, and it follows that if all the blood in
a man could be aerated with one breath, he might then seal up his
nostrils and not fetch another for a considerable time.  That is to
say, he would then live without breathing.  Anomalous as it may seem,
this is precisely the case with the whale, who systematically lives,
by intervals, his full hour and more (when at the bottom) without
drawing a single breath, or so much as in any way inhaling a particle
of air; for, remember, he has no gills.  How is this?  Between his
ribs and on each side of his spine he is supplied with a remarkable
involved Cretan labyrinth of vermicelli-like vessels, which vessels,
when he quits the surface, are completely distended with oxygenated
blood.  So that for an hour or more, a thousand fathoms in the sea,
he carries a surplus stock of vitality in him, just as the camel
crossing the waterless desert carries a surplus supply of drink for
future use in its four supplementary stomachs.  The anatomical fact
of this labyrinth is indisputable; and that the supposition founded
upon it is reasonable and true, seems the more cogent to me, when I
consider the otherwise inexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in
HAVING HIS SPOUTINGS OUT, as the fishermen phrase it.  This is what I
mean.  If unmolested, upon rising to the surface, the Sperm Whale
will continue there for a period of time exactly uniform with all his
other unmolested risings.  Say he stays eleven minutes, and jets
seventy times, that is, respires seventy breaths; then whenever he
rises again, he will be sure to have his seventy breaths over again,
to a minute.  Now, if after he fetches a few breaths you alarm him,
so that he sounds, he will be always dodging up again to make good
his regular allowance of air.  And not till those seventy breaths are
told, will he finally go down to stay out his full term below.
Remark, however, that in different individuals these rates are
different; but in any one they are alike.  Now, why should the whale
thus insist upon having his spoutings out, unless it be to replenish
his reservoir of air, ere descending for good?  How obvious is it,
too, that this necessity for the whale's rising exposes him to all
the fatal hazards of the chase.  For not by hook or by net could
this vast leviathan be caught, when sailing a thousand fathoms
beneath the sunlight.  Not so much thy skill, then, O hunter, as the
great necessities that strike the victory to thee!

In man, breathing is incessantly going on--one breath only serving
for two or three pulsations; so that whatever other business he has
to attend to, waking or sleeping, breathe he must, or die he will.
But the Sperm Whale only breathes about one seventh or Sunday of his
time.

It has been said that the whale only breathes through his spout-hole;
if it could truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with water,
then I opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of
smell seems obliterated in him; for the only thing about him that at
all answers to his nose is that identical spout-hole; and being so
clogged with two elements, it could not be expected to have the power
of smelling.  But owing to the mystery of the spout--whether it be
water or whether it be vapour--no absolute certainty can as yet be
arrived at on this head.  Sure it is, nevertheless, that the Sperm
Whale has no proper olfactories.  But what does he want of them?  No
roses, no violets, no Cologne-water in the sea.

Furthermore, as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his
spouting canal, and as that long canal--like the grand Erie Canal--is
furnished with a sort of locks (that open and shut) for the downward
retention of air or the upward exclusion of water, therefore the
whale has no voice; unless you insult him by saying, that when he so
strangely rumbles, he talks through his nose.  But then again, what
has the whale to say?  Seldom have I known any profound being that
had anything to say to this world, unless forced to stammer out
something by way of getting a living.  Oh! happy that the world is
such an excellent listener!

Now, the spouting canal of the Sperm Whale, chiefly intended as it is
for the conveyance of air, and for several feet laid along,
horizontally, just beneath the upper surface of his head, and a
little to one side; this curious canal is very much like a gas-pipe
laid down in a city on one side of a street.  But the question
returns whether this gas-pipe is also a water-pipe; in other words,
whether the spout of the Sperm Whale is the mere vapour of the exhaled
breath, or whether that exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in
at the mouth, and discharged through the spiracle.  It is certain
that the mouth indirectly communicates with the spouting canal; but
it cannot be proved that this is for the purpose of discharging water
through the spiracle.  Because the greatest necessity for so doing
would seem to be, when in feeding he accidentally takes in water.
But the Sperm Whale's food is far beneath the surface, and there he
cannot spout even if he would.  Besides, if you regard him very
closely, and time him with your watch, you will find that when
unmolested, there is an undeviating rhyme between the periods of his
jets and the ordinary periods of respiration.

But why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject?  Speak
out!  You have seen him spout; then declare what the spout is; can
you not tell water from air?  My dear sir, in this world it is not so
easy to settle these plain things.  I have ever found your plain
things the knottiest of all.  And as for this whale spout, you might
almost stand in it, and yet be undecided as to what it is precisely.

The central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist
enveloping it; and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls
from it, when, always, when you are close enough to a whale to get a
close view of his spout, he is in a prodigious commotion, the water
cascading all around him.  And if at such times you should think that
you really perceived drops of moisture in the spout, how do you know
that they are not merely condensed from its vapour; or how do you know
that they are not those identical drops superficially lodged in the
spout-hole fissure, which is countersunk into the summit of the
whale's head?  For even when tranquilly swimming through the mid-day
sea in a calm, with his elevated hump sun-dried as a dromedary's in
the desert; even then, the whale always carries a small basin of
water on his head, as under a blazing sun you will sometimes see a
cavity in a rock filled up with rain.

Nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching
the precise nature of the whale spout.  It will not do for him to be
peering into it, and putting his face in it.  You cannot go with your
pitcher to this fountain and fill it, and bring it away.  For even
when coming into slight contact with the outer, vapoury shreds of the
jet, which will often happen, your skin will feverishly smart, from
the acridness of the thing so touching it.  And I know one, who
coming into still closer contact with the spout, whether with some
scientific object in view, or otherwise, I cannot say, the skin
peeled off from his cheek and arm.  Wherefore, among whalemen, the
spout is deemed poisonous; they try to evade it.  Another thing; I
have heard it said, and I do not much doubt it, that if the jet is
fairly spouted into your eyes, it will blind you.  The wisest thing
the investigator can do then, it seems to me, is to let this deadly
spout alone.

Still, we can hypothesize, even if we cannot prove and establish.  My
hypothesis is this: that the spout is nothing but mist.  And besides
other reasons, to this conclusion I am impelled, by considerations
touching the great inherent dignity and sublimity of the Sperm Whale;
I account him no common, shallow being, inasmuch as it is an
undisputed fact that he is never found on soundings, or near shores;
all other whales sometimes are.  He is both ponderous and profound.
And I am convinced that from the heads of all ponderous profound
beings, such as Plato, Pyrrho, the Devil, Jupiter, Dante, and so on,
there always goes up a certain semi-visible steam, while in the act
of thinking deep thoughts.  While composing a little treatise on
Eternity, I had the curiosity to place a mirror before me; and ere
long saw reflected there, a curious involved worming and undulation
in the atmosphere over my head.  The invariable moisture of my hair,
while plunged in deep thought, after six cups of hot tea in my thin
shingled attic, of an August noon; this seems an additional argument
for the above supposition.

And how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty, misty monster, to
behold him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea; his vast,
mild head overhung by a canopy of vapour, engendered by his
incommunicable contemplations, and that vapour--as you will sometimes
see it--glorified by a rainbow, as if Heaven itself had put its seal
upon his thoughts.  For, d'ye see, rainbows do not visit the clear
air; they only irradiate vapour.  And so, through all the thick mists
of the dim doubts in my mind, divine intuitions now and then shoot,
enkindling my fog with a heavenly ray.  And for this I thank God; for
all have doubts; many deny; but doubts or denials, few along with
them, have intuitions.  Doubts of all things earthly, and intuitions
of some things heavenly; this combination makes neither believer nor
infidel, but makes a man who regards them both with equal eye.



CHAPTER 86

The Tail.


Other poets have warbled the praises of the soft eye of the antelope,
and the lovely plumage of the bird that never alights; less
celestial, I celebrate a tail.

Reckoning the largest sized Sperm Whale's tail to begin at that point
of the trunk where it tapers to about the girth of a man, it
comprises upon its upper surface alone, an area of at least fifty
square feet.  The compact round body of its root expands into two
broad, firm, flat palms or flukes, gradually shoaling away to less
than an inch in thickness.  At the crotch or junction, these flukes
slightly overlap, then sideways recede from each other like wings,
leaving a wide vacancy between.  In no living thing are the lines of
beauty more exquisitely defined than in the crescentic borders of
these flukes.  At its utmost expansion in the full grown whale, the
tail will considerably exceed twenty feet across.

The entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews; but cut
into it, and you find that three distinct strata compose it:--upper,
middle, and lower.  The fibres in the upper and lower layers, are
long and horizontal; those of the middle one, very short, and running
crosswise between the outside layers.  This triune structure, as much
as anything else, imparts power to the tail.  To the student of old
Roman walls, the middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to the
thin course of tiles always alternating with the stone in those
wonderful relics of the antique, and which undoubtedly contribute so
much to the great strength of the masonry.

But as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not
enough, the whole bulk of the leviathan is knit over with a warp and
woof of muscular fibres and filaments, which passing on either side
the loins and running down into the flukes, insensibly blend with
them, and largely contribute to their might; so that in the tail the
confluent measureless force of the whole whale seems concentrated to
a point.  Could annihilation occur to matter, this were the thing to
do it.

Nor does this--its amazing strength, at all tend to cripple the
graceful flexion of its motions; where infantileness of ease
undulates through a Titanism of power.  On the contrary, those
motions derive their most appalling beauty from it.  Real strength
never impairs beauty or harmony, but it often bestows it; and in
everything imposingly beautiful, strength has much to do with the
magic.  Take away the tied tendons that all over seem bursting from
the marble in the carved Hercules, and its charm would be gone.  As
devout Eckerman lifted the linen sheet from the naked corpse of
Goethe, he was overwhelmed with the massive chest of the man, that
seemed as a Roman triumphal arch.  When Angelo paints even God the
Father in human form, mark what robustness is there.  And whatever
they may reveal of the divine love in the Son, the soft, curled,
hermaphroditical Italian pictures, in which his idea has been most
successfully embodied; these pictures, so destitute as they are of
all brawniness, hint nothing of any power, but the mere negative,
feminine one of submission and endurance, which on all hands it is
conceded, form the peculiar practical virtues of his teachings.

Such is the subtle elasticity of the organ I treat of, that whether
wielded in sport, or in earnest, or in anger, whatever be the mood it
be in, its flexions are invariably marked by exceeding grace.
Therein no fairy's arm can transcend it.

Five great motions are peculiar to it.  First, when used as a fin for
progression; Second, when used as a mace in battle; Third, in
sweeping; Fourth, in lobtailing; Fifth, in peaking flukes.

First: Being horizontal in its position, the Leviathan's tail acts in
a different manner from the tails of all other sea creatures.  It
never wriggles.  In man or fish, wriggling is a sign of inferiority.
To the whale, his tail is the sole means of propulsion.  Scroll-wise
coiled forwards beneath the body, and then rapidly sprung backwards,
it is this which gives that singular darting, leaping motion to the
monster when furiously swimming.  His side-fins only serve to steer
by.

Second: It is a little significant, that while one sperm whale only
fights another sperm whale with his head and jaw, nevertheless, in
his conflicts with man, he chiefly and contemptuously uses his tail.
In striking at a boat, he swiftly curves away his flukes from it, and
the blow is only inflicted by the recoil.  If it be made in the
unobstructed air, especially if it descend to its mark, the stroke is
then simply irresistible.  No ribs of man or boat can withstand it.
Your only salvation lies in eluding it; but if it comes sideways
through the opposing water, then partly owing to the light buoyancy
of the whale boat, and the elasticity of its materials, a cracked
rib or a dashed plank or two, a sort of stitch in the side, is
generally the most serious result.  These submerged side blows are so
often received in the fishery, that they are accounted mere child's
play.  Some one strips off a frock, and the hole is stopped.

Third: I cannot demonstrate it, but it seems to me, that in the whale
the sense of touch is concentrated in the tail; for in this respect
there is a delicacy in it only equalled by the daintiness of the
elephant's trunk.  This delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of
sweeping, when in maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain soft
slowness moves his immense flukes from side to side upon the surface of
the sea; and if he feel but a sailor's whisker, woe to that sailor,
whiskers and all.  What tenderness there is in that preliminary
touch!  Had this tail any prehensile power, I should straightway
bethink me of Darmonodes' elephant that so frequented the
flower-market, and with low salutations presented nosegays to
damsels, and then caressed their zones.  On more accounts than one, a
pity it is that the whale does not possess this prehensile virtue in
his tail; for I have heard of yet another elephant, that when wounded
in the fight, curved round his trunk and extracted the dart.

Fourth: Stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of
the middle of solitary seas, you find him unbent from the vast
corpulence of his dignity, and kitten-like, he plays on the ocean as
if it were a hearth.  But still you see his power in his play.  The
broad palms of his tail are flirted high into the air; then smiting
the surface, the thunderous concussion resounds for miles.  You would
almost think a great gun had been discharged; and if you noticed the
light wreath of vapour from the spiracle at his other extremity, you
would think that that was the smoke from the touch-hole.

Fifth: As in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the
flukes lie considerably below the level of his back, they are then
completely out of sight beneath the surface; but when he is about to
plunge into the deeps, his entire flukes with at least thirty feet of
his body are tossed erect in the air, and so remain vibrating a
moment, till they downwards shoot out of view.  Excepting the sublime
BREACH--somewhere else to be described--this peaking of the whale's
flukes is perhaps the grandest sight to be seen in all animated
nature.  Out of the bottomless profundities the gigantic tail seems
spasmodically snatching at the highest heaven.  So in dreams, have I
seen majestic Satan thrusting forth his tormented colossal claw from
the flame Baltic of Hell.  But in gazing at such scenes, it is all in
all what mood you are in; if in the Dantean, the devils will occur to
you; if in that of Isaiah, the archangels.  Standing at the mast-head
of my ship during a sunrise that crimsoned sky and sea, I once saw a
large herd of whales in the east, all heading towards the sun, and
for a moment vibrating in concert with peaked flukes.  As it seemed
to me at the time, such a grand embodiment of adoration of the gods
was never beheld, even in Persia, the home of the fire worshippers.
As Ptolemy Philopater testified of the African elephant, I then
testified of the whale, pronouncing him the most devout of all
beings.  For according to King Juba, the military elephants of
antiquity often hailed the morning with their trunks uplifted in the
profoundest silence.

The chance comparison in this chapter, between the whale and the
elephant, so far as some aspects of the tail of the one and the trunk
of the other are concerned, should not tend to place those two
opposite organs on an equality, much less the creatures to which they
respectively belong.  For as the mightiest elephant is but a terrier
to Leviathan, so, compared with Leviathan's tail, his trunk is but
the stalk of a lily.  The most direful blow from the elephant's trunk
were as the playful tap of a fan, compared with the measureless crush
and crash of the sperm whale's ponderous flukes, which in repeated
instances have one after the other hurled entire boats with all their
oars and crews into the air, very much as an Indian juggler tosses
his balls.*


*Though all comparison in the way of general bulk between the whale
and the elephant is preposterous, inasmuch as in that particular the
elephant stands in much the same respect to the whale that a dog does
to the elephant; nevertheless, there are not wanting some points of
curious similitude; among these is the spout.  It is well known that
the elephant will often draw up water or dust in his trunk, and then
elevating it, jet it forth in a stream.


The more I consider this mighty tail, the more do I deplore my
inability to express it.  At times there are gestures in it, which,
though they would well grace the hand of man, remain wholly
inexplicable.  In an extensive herd, so remarkable, occasionally, are
these mystic gestures, that I have heard hunters who have declared
them akin to Free-Mason signs and symbols; that the whale, indeed, by
these methods intelligently conversed with the world.  Nor are there
wanting other motions of the whale in his general body, full of
strangeness, and unaccountable to his most experienced assailant.
Dissect him how I may, then, I but go skin deep; I know him not,
and never will.  But if I know not even the tail of this whale, how
understand his head? much more, how comprehend his face, when face he
has none?  Thou shalt see my back parts, my tail, he seems to say,
but my face shall not be seen.  But I cannot completely make out his
back parts; and hint what he will about his face, I say again he has
no face.



CHAPTER 87

The Grand Armada.


The long and narrow peninsula of Malacca, extending south-eastward
from the territories of Birmah, forms the most southerly point of all
Asia.  In a continuous line from that peninsula stretch the long
islands of Sumatra, Java, Bally, and Timor; which, with many others,
form a vast mole, or rampart, lengthwise connecting Asia with
Australia, and dividing the long unbroken Indian ocean from the
thickly studded oriental archipelagoes.  This rampart is pierced by
several sally-ports for the convenience of ships and whales;
conspicuous among which are the straits of Sunda and Malacca.  By the
straits of Sunda, chiefly, vessels bound to China from the west,
emerge into the China seas.

Those narrow straits of Sunda divide Sumatra from Java; and standing
midway in that vast rampart of islands, buttressed by that bold green
promontory, known to seamen as Java Head; they not a little
correspond to the central gateway opening into some vast walled
empire: and considering the inexhaustible wealth of spices, and
silks, and jewels, and gold, and ivory, with which the thousand
islands of that oriental sea are enriched, it seems a significant
provision of nature, that such treasures, by the very formation of
the land, should at least bear the appearance, however ineffectual,
of being guarded from the all-grasping western world.  The shores of
the Straits of Sunda are unsupplied with those domineering fortresses
which guard the entrances to the Mediterranean, the Baltic, and the
Propontis.  Unlike the Danes, these Orientals do not demand the
obsequious homage of lowered top-sails from the endless procession of
ships before the wind, which for centuries past, by night and by day,
have passed between the islands of Sumatra and Java, freighted with
the costliest cargoes of the east.  But while they freely waive a
ceremonial like this, they do by no means renounce their claim to
more solid tribute.

Time out of mind the piratical proas of the Malays, lurking among the
low shaded coves and islets of Sumatra, have sallied out upon the
vessels sailing through the straits, fiercely demanding tribute at
the point of their spears.  Though by the repeated bloody
chastisements they have received at the hands of European cruisers,
the audacity of these corsairs has of late been somewhat repressed;
yet, even at the present day, we occasionally hear of English and
American vessels, which, in those waters, have been remorselessly
boarded and pillaged.

With a fair, fresh wind, the Pequod was now drawing nigh to these
straits; Ahab purposing to pass through them into the Javan sea, and
thence, cruising northwards, over waters known to be frequented here
and there by the Sperm Whale, sweep inshore by the Philippine
Islands, and gain the far coast of Japan, in time for the great
whaling season there.  By these means, the circumnavigating Pequod
would sweep almost all the known Sperm Whale cruising grounds of the
world, previous to descending upon the Line in the Pacific; where
Ahab, though everywhere else foiled in his pursuit, firmly counted
upon giving battle to Moby Dick, in the sea he was most known to
frequent; and at a season when he might most reasonably be presumed
to be haunting it.

But how now? in this zoned quest, does Ahab touch no land? does his
crew drink air?  Surely, he will stop for water.  Nay.  For a long
time, now, the circus-running sun has raced within his fiery ring,
and needs no sustenance but what's in himself.  So Ahab.  Mark this,
too, in the whaler.  While other hulls are loaded down with alien
stuff, to be transferred to foreign wharves; the world-wandering
whale-ship carries no cargo but herself and crew, their weapons and
their wants.  She has a whole lake's contents bottled in her ample
hold.  She is ballasted with utilities; not altogether with unusable
pig-lead and kentledge.  She carries years' water in her.  Clear old
prime Nantucket water; which, when three years afloat, the
Nantucketer, in the Pacific, prefers to drink before the brackish
fluid, but yesterday rafted off in casks, from the Peruvian or Indian
streams.  Hence it is, that, while other ships may have gone to China
from New York, and back again, touching at a score of ports, the
whale-ship, in all that interval, may not have sighted one grain of
soil; her crew having seen no man but floating seamen like
themselves.  So that did you carry them the news that another flood
had come; they would only answer--Well, boys, here's the ark!

Now, as many Sperm Whales had been captured off the western coast of
Java, in the near vicinity of the Straits of Sunda; indeed, as most
of the ground, roundabout, was generally recognised by the fishermen
as an excellent spot for cruising; therefore, as the Pequod gained
more and more upon Java Head, the look-outs were repeatedly hailed,
and admonished to keep wide awake.  But though the green palmy cliffs
of the land soon loomed on the starboard bow, and with delighted
nostrils the fresh cinnamon was snuffed in the air, yet not a single
jet was descried.  Almost renouncing all thought of falling in with
any game hereabouts, the ship had well nigh entered the straits, when
the customary cheering cry was heard from aloft, and ere long a
spectacle of singular magnificence saluted us.

But here be it premised, that owing to the unwearied activity with
which of late they have been hunted over all four oceans, the Sperm
Whales, instead of almost invariably sailing in small detached
companies, as in former times, are now frequently met with in
extensive herds, sometimes embracing so great a multitude, that it
would almost seem as if numerous nations of them had sworn solemn
league and covenant for mutual assistance and protection.  To this
aggregation of the Sperm Whale into such immense caravans, may be
imputed the circumstance that even in the best cruising grounds, you
may now sometimes sail for weeks and months together, without being
greeted by a single spout; and then be suddenly saluted by what
sometimes seems thousands on thousands.

Broad on both bows, at the distance of some two or three miles, and
forming a great semicircle, embracing one half of the level horizon,
a continuous chain of whale-jets were up-playing and sparkling in the
noon-day air.  Unlike the straight perpendicular twin-jets of the
Right Whale, which, dividing at top, fall over in two branches, like
the cleft drooping boughs of a willow, the single forward-slanting
spout of the Sperm Whale presents a thick curled bush of white mist,
continually rising and falling away to leeward.

Seen from the Pequod's deck, then, as she would rise on a high hill
of the sea, this host of vapoury spouts, individually curling up into
the air, and beheld through a blending atmosphere of bluish haze,
showed like the thousand cheerful chimneys of some dense metropolis,
descried of a balmy autumnal morning, by some horseman on a height.

As marching armies approaching an unfriendly defile in the mountains,
accelerate their march, all eagerness to place that perilous passage
in their rear, and once more expand in comparative security upon the
plain; even so did this vast fleet of whales now seem hurrying
forward through the straits; gradually contracting the wings of their
semicircle, and swimming on, in one solid, but still crescentic
centre.

Crowding all sail the Pequod pressed after them; the harpooneers
handling their weapons, and loudly cheering from the heads of their
yet suspended boats.  If the wind only held, little doubt had they,
that chased through these Straits of Sunda, the vast host would only
deploy into the Oriental seas to witness the capture of not a few of
their number.  And who could tell whether, in that congregated
caravan, Moby Dick himself might not temporarily be swimming, like
the worshipped white-elephant in the coronation procession of the
Siamese!  So with stun-sail piled on stun-sail, we sailed along,
driving these leviathans before us; when, of a sudden, the voice of
Tashtego was heard, loudly directing attention to something in our
wake.

Corresponding to the crescent in our van, we beheld another in our
rear.  It seemed formed of detached white vapours, rising and falling
something like the spouts of the whales; only they did not so
completely come and go; for they constantly hovered, without finally
disappearing.  Levelling his glass at this sight, Ahab quickly
revolved in his pivot-hole, crying, Aloft there, and rig whips and"
6646	"buckets to wet the sails;--Malays, sir, and after us!

As if too long lurking behind the headlands, till the Pequod should
fairly have entered the straits, these rascally Asiatics were now in
hot pursuit, to make up for their over-cautious delay.  But when the
swift Pequod, with a fresh leading wind, was herself in hot chase;
how very kind of these tawny philanthropists to assist in speeding
her on to her own chosen pursuit,--mere riding-whips and rowels to
her, that they were.  As with glass under arm, Ahab to-and-fro paced
the deck; in his forward turn beholding the monsters he chased, and
in the after one the bloodthirsty pirates chasing him; some such
fancy as the above seemed his.  And when he glanced upon the green
walls of the watery defile in which the ship was then sailing, and
bethought him that through that gate lay the route to his vengeance,
and beheld, how that through that same gate he was now both chasing
and being chased to his deadly end; and not only that, but a herd of
remorseless wild pirates and inhuman atheistical devils were
infernally cheering him on with their curses;--when all these
conceits had passed through his brain, Ahab's brow was left gaunt and
ribbed, like the black sand beach after some stormy tide has been
gnawing it, without being able to drag the firm thing from its place.

But thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew; and
when, after steadily dropping and dropping the pirates astern, the
Pequod at last shot by the vivid green Cockatoo Point on the Sumatra
side, emerging at last upon the broad waters beyond; then, the
harpooneers seemed more to grieve that the swift whales had been
gaining upon the ship, than to rejoice that the ship had so
victoriously gained upon the Malays.  But still driving on in the
wake of the whales, at length they seemed abating their speed;
gradually the ship neared them; and the wind now dying away, word was
passed to spring to the boats.  But no sooner did the herd, by some
presumed wonderful instinct of the Sperm Whale, become notified of
the three keels that were after them,--though as yet a mile in their
rear,--than they rallied again, and forming in close ranks and
battalions, so that their spouts all looked like flashing lines of
stacked bayonets, moved on with redoubled velocity.

Stripped to our shirts and drawers, we sprang to the white-ash, and
after several hours' pulling were almost disposed to renounce the
chase, when a general pausing commotion among the whales gave
animating token that they were now at last under the influence of
that strange perplexity of inert irresolution, which, when the
fishermen perceive it in the whale, they say he is gallied.  The
compact martial columns in which they had been hitherto rapidly and
steadily swimming, were now broken up in one measureless rout; and
like King Porus' elephants in the Indian battle with Alexander, they
seemed going mad with consternation.  In all directions expanding in
vast irregular circles, and aimlessly swimming hither and thither, by
their short thick spoutings, they plainly betrayed their distraction
of panic.  This was still more strangely evinced by those of their
number, who, completely paralysed as it were, helplessly floated like
water-logged dismantled ships on the sea.  Had these Leviathans been
but a flock of simple sheep, pursued over the pasture by three fierce
wolves, they could not possibly have evinced such excessive dismay.
But this occasional timidity is characteristic of almost all herding
creatures.  Though banding together in tens of thousands, the
lion-maned buffaloes of the West have fled before a solitary
horseman.  Witness, too, all human beings, how when herded together
in the sheepfold of a theatre's pit, they will, at the slightest
alarm of fire, rush helter-skelter for the outlets, crowding,
trampling, jamming, and remorselessly dashing each other to death.
Best, therefore, withhold any amazement at the strangely gallied
whales before us, for there is no folly of the beasts of the earth
which is not infinitely outdone by the madness of men.

Though many of the whales, as has been said, were in violent motion,
yet it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced
nor retreated, but collectively remained in one place.  As is
customary in those cases, the boats at once separated, each making
for some one lone whale on the outskirts of the shoal.  In about
three minutes' time, Queequeg's harpoon was flung; the stricken fish
darted blinding spray in our faces, and then running away with us like
light, steered straight for the heart of the herd.  Though such a
movement on the part of the whale struck under such circumstances, is
in no wise unprecedented; and indeed is almost always more or less
anticipated; yet does it present one of the more perilous
vicissitudes of the fishery.  For as the swift monster drags you
deeper and deeper into the frantic shoal, you bid adieu to
circumspect life and only exist in a delirious throb.

As, blind and deaf, the whale plunged forward, as if by sheer power
of speed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him;
as we thus tore a white gash in the sea, on all sides menaced as we
flew, by the crazed creatures to and fro rushing about us; our beset
boat was like a ship mobbed by ice-isles in a tempest, and striving
to steer through their complicated channels and straits, knowing not at
what moment it may be locked in and crushed.

But not a bit daunted, Queequeg steered us manfully; now sheering off
from this monster directly across our route in advance; now edging
away from that, whose colossal flukes were suspended overhead, while
all the time, Starbuck stood up in the bows, lance in hand, pricking
out of our way whatever whales he could reach by short darts, for
there was no time to make long ones.  Nor were the oarsmen quite
idle, though their wonted duty was now altogether dispensed with.
They chiefly attended to the shouting part of the business.  Out of"
6647	"the way, Commodore! cried one, to a great dromedary that of a sudden
rose bodily to the surface, and for an instant threatened to swamp
us.  Hard down with your tail, there! cried a second to another,
which, close to our gunwale, seemed calmly cooling himself with his
own fan-like extremity.

All whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances, originally
invented by the Nantucket Indians, called druggs.  Two thick squares
of wood of equal size are stoutly clenched together, so that they
cross each other's grain at right angles; a line of considerable
length is then attached to the middle of this block, and the other
end of the line being looped, it can in a moment be fastened to a
harpoon.  It is chiefly among gallied whales that this drugg is used.
For then, more whales are close round you than you can possibly
chase at one time.  But sperm whales are not every day encountered;
while you may, then, you must kill all you can.  And if you cannot
kill them all at once, you must wing them, so that they can be
afterwards killed at your leisure.  Hence it is, that at times like
these the drugg, comes into requisition.  Our boat was furnished with
three of them.  The first and second were successfully darted, and we
saw the whales staggeringly running off, fettered by the enormous
sidelong resistance of the towing drugg.  They were cramped like
malefactors with the chain and ball.  But upon flinging the third, in
the act of tossing overboard the clumsy wooden block, it caught under
one of the seats of the boat, and in an instant tore it out and
carried it away, dropping the oarsman in the boat's bottom as the
seat slid from under him.  On both sides the sea came in at the
wounded planks, but we stuffed two or three drawers and shirts in,
and so stopped the leaks for the time.

It had been next to impossible to dart these drugged-harpoons, were
it not that as we advanced into the herd, our whale's way greatly
diminished; moreover, that as we went still further and further from
the circumference of commotion, the direful disorders seemed waning.
So that when at last the jerking harpoon drew out, and the towing
whale sideways vanished; then, with the tapering force of his parting
momentum, we glided between two whales into the innermost heart of
the shoal, as if from some mountain torrent we had slid into a serene
valley lake.  Here the storms in the roaring glens between the
outermost whales, were heard but not felt.  In this central expanse
the sea presented that smooth satin-like surface, called a sleek,
produced by the subtle moisture thrown off by the whale in his more
quiet moods.  Yes, we were now in that enchanted calm which they say
lurks at the heart of every commotion.  And still in the distracted
distance we beheld the tumults of the outer concentric circles, and
saw successive pods of whales, eight or ten in each, swiftly going
round and round, like multiplied spans of horses in a ring; and so
closely shoulder to shoulder, that a Titanic circus-rider might
easily have over-arched the middle ones, and so have gone round on
their backs.  Owing to the density of the crowd of reposing whales,
more immediately surrounding the embayed axis of the herd, no
possible chance of escape was at present afforded us.  We must watch
for a breach in the living wall that hemmed us in; the wall that had
only admitted us in order to shut us up.  Keeping at the centre of
the lake, we were occasionally visited by small tame cows and calves;
the women and children of this routed host.

Now, inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between the revolving
outer circles, and inclusive of the spaces between the various pods
in any one of those circles, the entire area at this juncture,
embraced by the whole multitude, must have contained at least two or
three square miles.  At any rate--though indeed such a test at such a
time might be deceptive--spoutings might be discovered from our low
boat that seemed playing up almost from the rim of the horizon.  I
mention this circumstance, because, as if the cows and calves had
been purposely locked up in this innermost fold; and as if the wide
extent of the herd had hitherto prevented them from learning the
precise cause of its stopping; or, possibly, being so young,
unsophisticated, and every way innocent and inexperienced; however it
may have been, these smaller whales--now and then visiting our
becalmed boat from the margin of the lake--evinced a wondrous
fearlessness and confidence, or else a still becharmed panic which it
was impossible not to marvel at.  Like household dogs they came
snuffling round us, right up to our gunwales, and touching them; till
it almost seemed that some spell had suddenly domesticated them.
Queequeg patted their foreheads; Starbuck scratched their backs with
his lance; but fearful of the consequences, for the time refrained
from darting it.

But far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface, another and
still stranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side.  For,
suspended in those watery vaults, floated the forms of the nursing
mothers of the whales, and those that by their enormous girth seemed
shortly to become mothers.  The lake, as I have hinted, was to a
considerable depth exceedingly transparent; and as human infants
while suckling will calmly and fixedly gaze away from the breast, as
if leading two different lives at the time; and while yet drawing
mortal nourishment, be still spiritually feasting upon some unearthly
reminiscence;--even so did the young of these whales seem looking up
towards us, but not at us, as if we were but a bit of Gulfweed in
their new-born sight.  Floating on their sides, the mothers also
seemed quietly eyeing us.  One of these little infants, that from
certain queer tokens seemed hardly a day old, might have measured
some fourteen feet in length, and some six feet in girth.  He was a
little frisky; though as yet his body seemed scarce yet recovered
from that irksome position it had so lately occupied in the maternal
reticule; where, tail to head, and all ready for the final spring,
the unborn whale lies bent like a Tartar's bow.  The delicate
side-fins, and the palms of his flukes, still freshly retained the
plaited crumpled appearance of a baby's ears newly arrived from
foreign parts.

Line! line! cried Queequeg, looking over the gunwale; him fast!"
6648	him fast!--Who line him!  Who struck?--Two whale; one big, one
6649	"little!

What ails ye, man? cried Starbuck.

Look-e here, said Queequeg, pointing down.

As when the stricken whale, that from the tub has reeled out hundreds
of fathoms of rope; as, after deep sounding, he floats up again, and
shows the slackened curling line buoyantly rising and spiralling
towards the air; so now, Starbuck saw long coils of the umbilical
cord of Madame Leviathan, by which the young cub seemed still
tethered to its dam.  Not seldom in the rapid vicissitudes of the
chase, this natural line, with the maternal end loose, becomes
entangled with the hempen one, so that the cub is thereby trapped.
Some of the subtlest secrets of the seas seemed divulged to us in
this enchanted pond.  We saw young Leviathan amours in the deep.*


*The sperm whale, as with all other species of the Leviathan, but
unlike most other fish, breeds indifferently at all seasons; after a
gestation which may probably be set down at nine months, producing
but one at a time; though in some few known instances giving birth to
an Esau and Jacob:--a contingency provided for in suckling by two
teats, curiously situated, one on each side of the anus; but the
breasts themselves extend upwards from that.  When by chance these
precious parts in a nursing whale are cut by the hunter's lance, the
mother's pouring milk and blood rivallingly discolour the sea for
rods.  The milk is very sweet and rich; it has been tasted by man; it
might do well with strawberries.  When overflowing with mutual
esteem, the whales salute MORE HOMINUM.


And thus, though surrounded by circle upon circle of consternations
and affrights, did these inscrutable creatures at the centre freely
and fearlessly indulge in all peaceful concernments; yea, serenely
revelled in dalliance and delight.  But even so, amid the tornadoed
Atlantic of my being, do I myself still for ever centrally disport in
mute calm; and while ponderous planets of unwaning woe revolve round
me, deep down and deep inland there I still bathe me in eternal
mildness of joy.

Meanwhile, as we thus lay entranced, the occasional sudden frantic
spectacles in the distance evinced the activity of the other boats,
still engaged in drugging the whales on the frontier of the host; or
possibly carrying on the war within the first circle, where abundance
of room and some convenient retreats were afforded them.  But the
sight of the enraged drugged whales now and then blindly darting to
and fro across the circles, was nothing to what at last met our eyes.
It is sometimes the custom when fast to a whale more than commonly
powerful and alert, to seek to hamstring him, as it were, by
sundering or maiming his gigantic tail-tendon.  It is done by darting
a short-handled cutting-spade, to which is attached a rope for
hauling it back again.  A whale wounded (as we afterwards learned) in
this part, but not effectually, as it seemed, had broken away from
the boat, carrying along with him half of the harpoon line; and in
the extraordinary agony of the wound, he was now dashing among the
revolving circles like the lone mounted desperado Arnold, at the
battle of Saratoga, carrying dismay wherever he went.

But agonizing as was the wound of this whale, and an appalling
spectacle enough, any way; yet the peculiar horror with which he
seemed to inspire the rest of the herd, was owing to a cause which at
first the intervening distance obscured from us.  But at length we
perceived that by one of the unimaginable accidents of the fishery,
this whale had become entangled in the harpoon-line that he towed; he
had also run away with the cutting-spade in him; and while the free
end of the rope attached to that weapon, had permanently caught in
the coils of the harpoon-line round his tail, the cutting-spade
itself had worked loose from his flesh.  So that tormented to
madness, he was now churning through the water, violently flailing
with his flexible tail, and tossing the keen spade about him,
wounding and murdering his own comrades.

This terrific object seemed to recall the whole herd from their
stationary fright.  First, the whales forming the margin of our lake
began to crowd a little, and tumble against each other, as if lifted
by half spent billows from afar; then the lake itself began faintly
to heave and swell; the submarine bridal-chambers and nurseries
vanished; in more and more contracting orbits the whales in the more
central circles began to swim in thickening clusters.  Yes, the long
calm was departing.  A low advancing hum was soon heard; and then
like to the tumultuous masses of block-ice when the great river
Hudson breaks up in Spring, the entire host of whales came tumbling
upon their inner centre, as if to pile themselves up in one common
mountain.  Instantly Starbuck and Queequeg changed places; Starbuck
taking the stern.

Oars!  Oars! he intensely whispered, seizing the helm--gripe your"
6650	oars, and clutch your souls, now!  My God, men, stand by!  Shove him
6651	off, you Queequeg--the whale there!--prick him!--hit him!  Stand
6652	up--stand up, and stay so!  Spring, men--pull, men; never mind their
6653	"backs--scrape them!--scrape away!

The boat was now all but jammed between two vast black bulks, leaving
a narrow Dardanelles between their long lengths.  But by desperate
endeavor we at last shot into a temporary opening; then giving way
rapidly, and at the same time earnestly watching for another outlet.
After many similar hair-breadth escapes, we at last swiftly glided
into what had just been one of the outer circles, but now crossed by
random whales, all violently making for one centre.  This lucky
salvation was cheaply purchased by the loss of Queequeg's hat, who,
while standing in the bows to prick the fugitive whales, had his hat
taken clean from his head by the air-eddy made by the sudden tossing
of a pair of broad flukes close by.

Riotous and disordered as the universal commotion now was, it soon
resolved itself into what seemed a systematic movement; for having
clumped together at last in one dense body, they then renewed their
onward flight with augmented fleetness.  Further pursuit was useless;
but the boats still lingered in their wake to pick up what drugged
whales might be dropped astern, and likewise to secure one which
Flask had killed and waifed.  The waif is a pennoned pole, two or
three of which are carried by every boat; and which, when additional
game is at hand, are inserted upright into the floating body of a
dead whale, both to mark its place on the sea, and also as token of
prior possession, should the boats of any other ship draw near.

The result of this lowering was somewhat illustrative of that
sagacious saying in the Fishery,--the more whales the less fish.  Of
all the drugged whales only one was captured.  The rest contrived to
escape for the time, but only to be taken, as will hereafter be seen,
by some other craft than the Pequod.

The previous chapter gave account of an immense body or herd of Sperm
Whales, and there was also then given the probable cause inducing
those vast aggregations.

Now, though such great bodies are at times encountered, yet, as must
have been seen, even at the present day, small detached bands are
occasionally observed, embracing from twenty to fifty individuals
each.  Such bands are known as schools.  They generally are of two
sorts; those composed almost entirely of females, and those mustering
none but young vigorous males, or bulls, as they are familiarly
designated.

In cavalier attendance upon the school of females, you invariably see
a male of full grown magnitude, but not old; who, upon any alarm,
evinces his gallantry by falling in the rear and covering the flight
of his ladies.  In truth, this gentleman is a luxurious Ottoman,
swimming about over the watery world, surroundingly accompanied by
all the solaces and endearments of the harem.  The contrast between
this Ottoman and his concubines is striking; because, while he is
always of the largest leviathanic proportions, the ladies, even at
full growth, are not more than one-third of the bulk of an
average-sized male.  They are comparatively delicate, indeed; I dare
say, not to exceed half a dozen yards round the waist.  Nevertheless,
it cannot be denied, that upon the whole they are hereditarily
entitled to EMBONPOINT.

It is very curious to watch this harem and its lord in their indolent
ramblings.  Like fashionables, they are for ever on the move in
leisurely search of variety.  You meet them on the Line in time for
the full flower of the Equatorial feeding season, having just
returned, perhaps, from spending the summer in the Northern seas, and
so cheating summer of all unpleasant weariness and warmth.  By the
time they have lounged up and down the promenade of the Equator
awhile, they start for the Oriental waters in anticipation of the
cool season there, and so evade the other excessive temperature of
the year.

When serenely advancing on one of these journeys, if any strange
suspicious sights are seen, my lord whale keeps a wary eye on his
interesting family.  Should any unwarrantably pert young Leviathan
coming that way, presume to draw confidentially close to one of the
ladies, with what prodigious fury the Bashaw assails him, and chases
him away!  High times, indeed, if unprincipled young rakes like him
are to be permitted to invade the sanctity of domestic bliss; though
do what the Bashaw will, he cannot keep the most notorious Lothario
out of his bed; for, alas! all fish bed in common.  As ashore, the
ladies often cause the most terrible duels among their rival
admirers; just so with the whales, who sometimes come to deadly
battle, and all for love.  They fence with their long lower jaws,
sometimes locking them together, and so striving for the supremacy
like elks that warringly interweave their antlers.  Not a few are
captured having the deep scars of these encounters,--furrowed heads,
broken teeth, scolloped fins; and in some instances, wrenched and
dislocated mouths.

But supposing the invader of domestic bliss to betake himself away at
the first rush of the harem's lord, then is it very diverting to
watch that lord.  Gently he insinuates his vast bulk among them again
and revels there awhile, still in tantalizing vicinity to young
Lothario, like pious Solomon devoutly worshipping among his thousand
concubines.  Granting other whales to be in sight, the fishermen
will seldom give chase to one of these Grand Turks; for these Grand
Turks are too lavish of their strength, and hence their unctuousness
is small.  As for the sons and the daughters they beget, why, those sons
and daughters must take care of themselves; at least, with only the
maternal help.  For like certain other omnivorous roving lovers that
might be named, my Lord Whale has no taste for the nursery, however
much for the bower; and so, being a great traveller, he leaves his
anonymous babies all over the world; every baby an exotic.  In good
time, nevertheless, as the ardour of youth declines; as years and
dumps increase; as reflection lends her solemn pauses; in short, as a
general lassitude overtakes the sated Turk; then a love of ease and
virtue supplants the love for maidens; our Ottoman enters upon the
impotent, repentant, admonitory stage of life, forswears, disbands
the harem, and grown to an exemplary, sulky old soul, goes about all
alone among the meridians and parallels saying his prayers, and
warning each young Leviathan from his amorous errors.

Now, as the harem of whales is called by the fishermen a school, so
is the lord and master of that school technically known as the
schoolmaster.  It is therefore not in strict character, however
admirably satirical, that after going to school himself, he should
then go abroad inculcating not what he learned there, but the folly
of it.  His title, schoolmaster, would very naturally seem derived
from the name bestowed upon the harem itself, but some have surmised
that the man who first thus entitled this sort of Ottoman whale, must
have read the memoirs of Vidocq, and informed himself what sort of a
country-schoolmaster that famous Frenchman was in his younger days,
and what was the nature of those occult lessons he inculcated into
some of his pupils.

The same secludedness and isolation to which the schoolmaster whale
betakes himself in his advancing years, is true of all aged Sperm
Whales.  Almost universally, a lone whale--as a solitary Leviathan is
called--proves an ancient one.  Like venerable moss-bearded Daniel
Boone, he will have no one near him but Nature herself; and her he
takes to wife in the wilderness of waters, and the best of wives she
is, though she keeps so many moody secrets.

The schools composing none but young and vigorous males, previously
mentioned, offer a strong contrast to the harem schools.  For while
those female whales are characteristically timid, the young males, or
forty-barrel-bulls, as they call them, are by far the most pugnacious
of all Leviathans, and proverbially the most dangerous to encounter;
excepting those wondrous grey-headed, grizzled whales, sometimes met,
and these will fight you like grim fiends exasperated by a penal
gout.

The Forty-barrel-bull schools are larger than the harem schools.
Like a mob of young collegians, they are full of fight, fun, and
wickedness, tumbling round the world at such a reckless, rollicking
rate, that no prudent underwriter would insure them any more than he
would a riotous lad at Yale or Harvard.  They soon relinquish this
turbulence though, and when about three-fourths grown, break up, and
separately go about in quest of settlements, that is, harems.

Another point of difference between the male and female schools is
still more characteristic of the sexes.  Say you strike a
Forty-barrel-bull--poor devil! all his comrades quit him.  But strike
a member of the harem school, and her companions swim around her with
every token of concern, sometimes lingering so near her and so long,
as themselves to fall a prey.



CHAPTER 89

Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish.


The allusion to the waif and waif-poles in the last chapter but one,
necessitates some account of the laws and regulations of the whale
fishery, of which the waif may be deemed the grand symbol and badge.

It frequently happens that when several ships are cruising in
company, a whale may be struck by one vessel, then escape, and be
finally killed and captured by another vessel; and herein are
indirectly comprised many minor contingencies, all partaking of this
one grand feature.  For example,--after a weary and perilous chase
and capture of a whale, the body may get loose from the ship by
reason of a violent storm; and drifting far away to leeward, be
retaken by a second whaler, who, in a calm, snugly tows it alongside,
without risk of life or line.  Thus the most vexatious and violent
disputes would often arise between the fishermen, were there not some
written or unwritten, universal, undisputed law applicable to all
cases.

Perhaps the only formal whaling code authorized by legislative
enactment, was that of Holland.  It was decreed by the States-General
in A.D. 1695.  But though no other nation has ever had any written
whaling law, yet the American fishermen have been their own
legislators and lawyers in this matter.  They have provided a system
which for terse comprehensiveness surpasses Justinian's Pandects and
the By-laws of the Chinese Society for the Suppression of Meddling
with other People's Business.  Yes; these laws might be engraven on a
Queen Anne's forthing, or the barb of a harpoon, and worn round the
neck, so small are they.

I.  A Fast-Fish belongs to the party fast to it.

II.  A Loose-Fish is fair game for anybody who can soonest catch it.

But what plays the mischief with this masterly code is the admirable
brevity of it, which necessitates a vast volume of commentaries to
expound it.

First: What is a Fast-Fish?  Alive or dead a fish is technically
fast, when it is connected with an occupied ship or boat, by any
medium at all controllable by the occupant or occupants,--a mast, an
oar, a nine-inch cable, a telegraph wire, or a strand of cobweb, it
is all the same.  Likewise a fish is technically fast when it bears a
waif, or any other recognised symbol of possession; so long as the
party waifing it plainly evince their ability at any time to take it
alongside, as well as their intention so to do.

These are scientific commentaries; but the commentaries of the
whalemen themselves sometimes consist in hard words and harder
knocks--the Coke-upon-Littleton of the fist.  True, among the more
upright and honourable whalemen allowances are always made for
peculiar cases, where it would be an outrageous moral injustice for
one party to claim possession of a whale previously chased or killed
by another party.  But others are by no means so scrupulous.

Some fifty years ago there was a curious case of whale-trover
litigated in England, wherein the plaintiffs set forth that after a
hard chase of a whale in the Northern seas; and when indeed they (the
plaintiffs) had succeeded in harpooning the fish; they were at last,
through peril of their lives, obliged to forsake not only their
lines, but their boat itself.  Ultimately the defendants (the crew of
another ship) came up with the whale, struck, killed, seized, and
finally appropriated it before the very eyes of the plaintiffs.  And
when those defendants were remonstrated with, their captain snapped
his fingers in the plaintiffs' teeth, and assured them that by way of
doxology to the deed he had done, he would now retain their line,
harpoons, and boat, which had remained attached to the whale at the
time of the seizure.  Wherefore the plaintiffs now sued for the
recovery of the value of their whale, line, harpoons, and boat.

Mr. Erskine was counsel for the defendants; Lord Ellenborough was the
judge.  In the course of the defence, the witty Erskine went on to
illustrate his position, by alluding to a recent crim. con. case,
wherein a gentleman, after in vain trying to bridle his wife's
viciousness, had at last abandoned her upon the seas of life; but in
the course of years, repenting of that step, he instituted an action
to recover possession of her.  Erskine was on the other side; and he
then supported it by saying, that though the gentleman had originally
harpooned the lady, and had once had her fast, and only by reason of
the great stress of her plunging viciousness, had at last abandoned
her; yet abandon her he did, so that she became a loose-fish; and
therefore when a subsequent gentleman re-harpooned her, the lady then
became that subsequent gentleman's property, along with whatever
harpoon might have been found sticking in her.

Now in the present case Erskine contended that the examples of the
whale and the lady were reciprocally illustrative of each other.

These pleadings, and the counter pleadings, being duly heard, the
very learned Judge in set terms decided, to wit,--That as for the
boat, he awarded it to the plaintiffs, because they had merely
abandoned it to save their lives; but that with regard to the
controverted whale, harpoons, and line, they belonged to the
defendants; the whale, because it was a Loose-Fish at the time of the
final capture; and the harpoons and line because when the fish made
off with them, it (the fish) acquired a property in those articles;
and hence anybody who afterwards took the fish had a right to them.
Now the defendants afterwards took the fish; ergo, the aforesaid
articles were theirs.

A common man looking at this decision of the very learned Judge,
might possibly object to it.  But ploughed up to the primary rock of
the matter, the two great principles laid down in the twin whaling
laws previously quoted, and applied and elucidated by Lord
Ellenborough in the above cited case; these two laws touching
Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish, I say, will, on reflection, be found the
fundamentals of all human jurisprudence; for notwithstanding its
complicated tracery of sculpture, the Temple of the Law, like the
Temple of the Philistines, has but two props to stand on.

Is it not a saying in every one's mouth, Possession is half of the
law: that is, regardless of how the thing came into possession?  But
often possession is the whole of the law.  What are the sinews and
souls of Russian serfs and Republican slaves but Fast-Fish, whereof
possession is the whole of the law?  What to the rapacious landlord
is the widow's last mite but a Fast-Fish?  What is yonder undetected
villain's marble mansion with a door-plate for a waif; what is that
but a Fast-Fish?  What is the ruinous discount which Mordecai, the
broker, gets from poor Woebegone, the bankrupt, on a loan to
keep Woebegone's family from starvation; what is that ruinous
discount but a Fast-Fish?  What is the Archbishop of Savesoul's
income of L100,000 seized from the scant bread and cheese of
hundreds of thousands of broken-backed laborers (all sure of heaven
without any of Savesoul's help) what is that globular L100,000 but a
Fast-Fish?  What are the Duke of Dunder's hereditary towns and
hamlets but Fast-Fish?  What to that redoubted harpooneer, John Bull,
is poor Ireland, but a Fast-Fish?  What to that apostolic lancer,
Brother Jonathan, is Texas but a Fast-Fish?  And concerning all
these, is not Possession the whole of the law?

But if the doctrine of Fast-Fish be pretty generally applicable, the
kindred doctrine of Loose-Fish is still more widely so.  That is
internationally and universally applicable.

What was America in 1492 but a Loose-Fish, in which Columbus struck
the Spanish standard by way of waifing it for his royal master and
mistress?  What was Poland to the Czar?  What Greece to the Turk?
What India to England?  What at last will Mexico be to the United
States?  All Loose-Fish.

What are the Rights of Man and the Liberties of the World but
Loose-Fish?  What all men's minds and opinions but Loose-Fish?  What
is the principle of religious belief in them but a Loose-Fish?  What
to the ostentatious smuggling verbalists are the thoughts of thinkers
but Loose-Fish?  What is the great globe itself but a Loose-Fish?
And what are you, reader, but a Loose-Fish and a Fast-Fish, too?



CHAPTER 90

Heads or Tails.


De balena vero sufficit, si rex habeat caput, et regina caudam.
BRACTON, L. 3, C. 3.


Latin from the books of the Laws of England, which taken along with
the context, means, that of all whales captured by anybody on the
coast of that land, the King, as Honourary Grand Harpooneer, must have
the head, and the Queen be respectfully presented with the tail.  A
division which, in the whale, is much like halving an apple; there is
no intermediate remainder.  Now as this law, under a modified form,
is to this day in force in England; and as it offers in various
respects a strange anomaly touching the general law of Fast and
Loose-Fish, it is here treated of in a separate chapter, on the same
courteous principle that prompts the English railways to be at the
expense of a separate car, specially reserved for the accommodation
of royalty.  In the first place, in curious proof of the fact that
the above-mentioned law is still in force, I proceed to lay before
you a circumstance that happened within the last two years.

It seems that some honest mariners of Dover, or Sandwich, or some one
of the Cinque Ports, had after a hard chase succeeded in killing and
beaching a fine whale which they had originally descried afar off
from the shore.  Now the Cinque Ports are partially or somehow under
the jurisdiction of a sort of policeman or beadle, called a Lord
Warden.  Holding the office directly from the crown, I believe, all
the royal emoluments incident to the Cinque Port territories become
by assignment his.  By some writers this office is called a sinecure.
But not so.  Because the Lord Warden is busily employed at times in
fobbing his perquisites; which are his chiefly by virtue of that same
fobbing of them.

Now when these poor sun-burnt mariners, bare-footed, and with their
trowsers rolled high up on their eely legs, had wearily hauled their
fat fish high and dry, promising themselves a good L150 from the
precious oil and bone; and in fantasy sipping rare tea with their
wives, and good ale with their cronies, upon the strength of their
respective shares; up steps a very learned and most Christian and
charitable gentleman, with a copy of Blackstone under his arm; and
laying it upon the whale's head, he says--Hands off! this fish, my"
6654	"masters, is a Fast-Fish.  I seize it as the Lord Warden's.  Upon
this the poor mariners in their respectful consternation--so truly
English--knowing not what to say, fall to vigorously scratching their
heads all round; meanwhile ruefully glancing from the whale to the
stranger.  But that did in nowise mend the matter, or at all soften
the hard heart of the learned gentleman with the copy of Blackstone.
At length one of them, after long scratching about for his ideas,
made bold to speak,

Please, sir, who is the Lord Warden?

The Duke.

But the duke had nothing to do with taking this fish?

It is his.

We have been at great trouble, and peril, and some expense, and is"
6655	all that to go to the Duke's benefit; we getting nothing at all for
6656	"our pains but our blisters?

It is his.

Is the Duke so very poor as to be forced to this desperate mode of"
6657	"getting a livelihood?

It is his.

I thought to relieve my old bed-ridden mother by part of my share of"
6658	"this whale.

It is his.

Won't the Duke be content with a quarter or a half?

It is his.

In a word, the whale was seized and sold, and his Grace the Duke of
Wellington received the money.  Thinking that viewed in some
particular lights, the case might by a bare possibility in some small
degree be deemed, under the circumstances, a rather hard one, an
honest clergyman of the town respectfully addressed a note to his
Grace, begging him to take the case of those unfortunate mariners
into full consideration.  To which my Lord Duke in substance replied
(both letters were published) that he had already done so, and
received the money, and would be obliged to the reverend gentleman if
for the future he (the reverend gentleman) would decline meddling
with other people's business.  Is this the still militant old man,
standing at the corners of the three kingdoms, on all hands coercing
alms of beggars?

It will readily be seen that in this case the alleged right of the
Duke to the whale was a delegated one from the Sovereign.  We must
needs inquire then on what principle the Sovereign is originally
invested with that right.  The law itself has already been set forth.
But Plowdon gives us the reason for it.  Says Plowdon, the whale so
caught belongs to the King and Queen, because of its superior"
6659	"excellence.  And by the soundest commentators this has ever been
held a cogent argument in such matters.

But why should the King have the head, and the Queen the tail?  A
reason for that, ye lawyers!

In his treatise on Queen-Gold, or Queen-pinmoney, an old King's
Bench author, one William Prynne, thus discourseth: Ye tail is ye"
6660	"Queen's, that ye Queen's wardrobe may be supplied with ye whalebone.
Now this was written at a time when the black limber bone of the
Greenland or Right whale was largely used in ladies' bodices.  But
this same bone is not in the tail; it is in the head, which is a sad
mistake for a sagacious lawyer like Prynne.  But is the Queen a
mermaid, to be presented with a tail?  An allegorical meaning may
lurk here.

There are two royal fish so styled by the English law writers--the
whale and the sturgeon; both royal property under certain
limitations, and nominally supplying the tenth branch of the crown's
ordinary revenue.  I know not that any other author has hinted of the
matter; but by inference it seems to me that the sturgeon must be
divided in the same way as the whale, the King receiving the highly
dense and elastic head peculiar to that fish, which, symbolically
regarded, may possibly be humorously grounded upon some presumed
congeniality.  And thus there seems a reason in all things, even in
law.



CHAPTER 91

The Pequod Meets The Rose-Bud.


In vain it was to rake for Ambergriese in the paunch of this"
6661	"Leviathan, insufferable fetor denying not inquiry.
SIR T. BROWNE, V.E.


It was a week or two after the last whaling scene recounted, and when
we were slowly sailing over a sleepy, vapoury, mid-day sea, that the
many noses on the Pequod's deck proved more vigilant discoverers than
the three pairs of eyes aloft.  A peculiar and not very pleasant
smell was smelt in the sea.

I will bet something now, said Stubb, that somewhere hereabouts"
6662	are some of those drugged whales we tickled the other day.  I thought
6663	"they would keel up before long.

Presently, the vapours in advance slid aside; and there in the
distance lay a ship, whose furled sails betokened that some sort of
whale must be alongside.  As we glided nearer, the stranger showed
French colours from his peak; and by the eddying cloud of vulture
sea-fowl that circled, and hovered, and swooped around him, it was
plain that the whale alongside must be what the fishermen call a
blasted whale, that is, a whale that has died unmolested on the sea,
and so floated an unappropriated corpse.  It may well be conceived,
what an unsavory odor such a mass must exhale; worse than an Assyrian
city in the plague, when the living are incompetent to bury the
departed.  So intolerable indeed is it regarded by some, that no
cupidity could persuade them to moor alongside of it.  Yet are there
those who will still do it; notwithstanding the fact that the oil
obtained from such subjects is of a very inferior quality, and by no
means of the nature of attar-of-rose.

Coming still nearer with the expiring breeze, we saw that the
Frenchman had a second whale alongside; and this second whale seemed
even more of a nosegay than the first.  In truth, it turned out to be
one of those problematical whales that seem to dry up and die with a
sort of prodigious dyspepsia, or indigestion; leaving their defunct
bodies almost entirely bankrupt of anything like oil.  Nevertheless,
in the proper place we shall see that no knowing fisherman will ever
turn up his nose at such a whale as this, however much he may shun
blasted whales in general.

The Pequod had now swept so nigh to the stranger, that Stubb vowed he
recognised his cutting spade-pole entangled in the lines that were
knotted round the tail of one of these whales.

There's a pretty fellow, now, he banteringly laughed, standing in
the ship's bows, there's a jackal for ye!  I well know that these"
6664	Crappoes of Frenchmen are but poor devils in the fishery; sometimes
6665	lowering their boats for breakers, mistaking them for Sperm Whale
6666	spouts; yes, and sometimes sailing from their port with their hold
6667	full of boxes of tallow candles, and cases of snuffers, foreseeing
6668	that all the oil they will get won't be enough to dip the Captain's
6669	wick into; aye, we all know these things; but look ye, here's a
6670	Crappo that is content with our leavings, the drugged whale there, I
6671	mean; aye, and is content too with scraping the dry bones of that
6672	other precious fish he has there.  Poor devil!  I say, pass round a
6673	hat, some one, and let's make him a present of a little oil for dear
6674	charity's sake.  For what oil he'll get from that drugged whale
6675	there, wouldn't be fit to burn in a jail; no, not in a condemned
6676	cell.  And as for the other whale, why, I'll agree to get more oil by
6677	chopping up and trying out these three masts of ours, than he'll get
6678	from that bundle of bones; though, now that I think of it, it may
6679	contain something worth a good deal more than oil; yes, ambergris.  I
6680	wonder now if our old man has thought of that.  It's worth trying.
6681	"Yes, I'm for it; and so saying he started for the quarter-deck.

By this time the faint air had become a complete calm; so that
whether or no, the Pequod was now fairly entrapped in the smell, with
no hope of escaping except by its breezing up again.  Issuing from
the cabin, Stubb now called his boat's crew, and pulled off for the
stranger.  Drawing across her bow, he perceived that in accordance
with the fanciful French taste, the upper part of her stem-piece was
carved in the likeness of a huge drooping stalk, was painted green,
and for thorns had copper spikes projecting from it here and there;
the whole terminating in a symmetrical folded bulb of a bright red
colour.  Upon her head boards, in large gilt letters, he read Bouton"
6682	"de Rose,--Rose-button, or Rose-bud; and this was the romantic name
of this aromatic ship.

Though Stubb did not understand the BOUTON part of the inscription,
yet the word ROSE, and the bulbous figure-head put together,
sufficiently explained the whole to him.

A wooden rose-bud, eh? he cried with his hand to his nose, that"
6683	"will do very well; but how like all creation it smells!

Now in order to hold direct communication with the people on deck, he
had to pull round the bows to the starboard side, and thus come close
to the blasted whale; and so talk over it.

Arrived then at this spot, with one hand still to his nose, he
bawled--Bouton-de-Rose, ahoy! are there any of you Bouton-de-Roses"
6684	"that speak English?

Yes, rejoined a Guernsey-man from the bulwarks, who turned out to
be the chief-mate.

Well, then, my Bouton-de-Rose-bud, have you seen the White Whale?

WHAT whale?

The WHITE Whale--a Sperm Whale--Moby Dick, have ye seen him?"
6685	
6686	Never heard of such a whale.  Cachalot Blanche!  White Whale--no.
6687	
6688	Very good, then; good bye now, and I'll call again in a minute.
6689	
6690	Then rapidly pulling back towards the Pequod, and seeing Ahab leaning
6691	over the quarter-deck rail awaiting his report, he moulded his two
6692	hands into a trumpet and shouted--No, Sir!  No!  Upon which Ahab
6693	retired, and Stubb returned to the Frenchman.
6694	
6695	He now perceived that the Guernsey-man, who had just got into the
6696	chains, and was using a cutting-spade, had slung his nose in a sort
6697	of bag.
6698	
6699	What's the matter with your nose, there? said Stubb.  Broke it?
6700	
6701	I wish it was broken, or that I didn't have any nose at all!
6702	answered the Guernsey-man, who did not seem to relish the job he was
6703	at very much.  But what are you holding YOURS for?
6704	
6705	"Oh, nothing!  It's a wax nose; I have to hold it on.  Fine day,
ain't it?  Air rather gardenny, I should say; throw us a bunch of
posies, will ye, Bouton-de-Rose?"
6706	
6707	What in the devil's name do you want here? roared the Guernseyman,
6708	flying into a sudden passion.
6709	
6710	"Oh! keep cool--cool? yes, that's the word! why don't you pack those
whales in ice while you're working at 'em?  But joking aside, though;
do you know, Rose-bud, that it's all nonsense trying to get any oil
out of such whales?  As for that dried up one, there, he hasn't a
gill in his whole carcase."
6711	
6712	"I know that well enough; but, d'ye see, the Captain here won't
believe it; this is his first voyage; he was a Cologne manufacturer
before.  But come aboard, and mayhap he'll believe you, if he won't
me; and so I'll get out of this dirty scrape."
6713	
6714	Anything to oblige ye, my sweet and pleasant fellow, rejoined
6715	Stubb, and with that he soon mounted to the deck.  There a queer
6716	scene presented itself.  The sailors, in tasselled caps of red
6717	worsted, were getting the heavy tackles in readiness for the whales.
6718	But they worked rather slow and talked very fast, and seemed in
6719	anything but a good humor.  All their noses upwardly projected from
6720	their faces like so many jib-booms.  Now and then pairs of them would
6721	drop their work, and run up to the mast-head to get some fresh air.
6722	Some thinking they would catch the plague, dipped oakum in coal-tar,
6723	and at intervals held it to their nostrils.  Others having broken the
6724	stems of their pipes almost short off at the bowl, were vigorously
6725	puffing tobacco-smoke, so that it constantly filled their
6726	olfactories.
6727	
6728	Stubb was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas proceeding
6729	from the Captain's round-house abaft; and looking in that direction
6730	saw a fiery face thrust from behind the door, which was held ajar
6731	from within.  This was the tormented surgeon, who, after in vain
6732	remonstrating against the proceedings of the day, had betaken himself
6733	to the Captain's round-house (CABINET he called it) to avoid the
6734	pest; but still, could not help yelling out his entreaties and
6735	indignations at times.
6736	
6737	Marking all this, Stubb argued well for his scheme, and turning to
6738	the Guernsey-man had a little chat with him, during which the
6739	stranger mate expressed his detestation of his Captain as a conceited
6740	ignoramus, who had brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable
6741	a pickle.  Sounding him carefully, Stubb further perceived that the
6742	Guernsey-man had not the slightest suspicion concerning the
6743	ambergris.  He therefore held his peace on that head, but otherwise
6744	was quite frank and confidential with him, so that the two quickly
6745	concocted a little plan for both circumventing and satirizing the
6746	Captain, without his at all dreaming of distrusting their sincerity.
6747	According to this little plan of theirs, the Guernsey-man, under
6748	cover of an interpreter's office, was to tell the Captain what he
6749	pleased, but as coming from Stubb; and as for Stubb, he was to utter
6750	any nonsense that should come uppermost in him during the interview.
6751	
6752	By this time their destined victim appeared from his cabin.  He was a
6753	small and dark, but rather delicate looking man for a sea-captain,
6754	with large whiskers and moustache, however; and wore a red cotton
6755	velvet vest with watch-seals at his side.  To this gentleman, Stubb
6756	was now politely introduced by the Guernsey-man, who at once
6757	ostentatiously put on the aspect of interpreting between them.
6758	
6759	What shall I say to him first? said he.
6760	
6761	Why, said Stubb, eyeing the velvet vest and the watch and seals,
6762	"you may as well begin by telling him that he looks a sort of babyish
to me, though I don't pretend to be a judge."
6763	
6764	He says, Monsieur, said the Guernsey-man, in French, turning to his
6765	"captain, that only yesterday his ship spoke a vessel, whose captain
and chief-mate, with six sailors, had all died of a fever caught from
a blasted whale they had brought alongside."
6766	
6767	Upon this the captain started, and eagerly desired to know more.
6768	
6769	What now? said the Guernsey-man to Stubb.
6770	
6771	"Why, since he takes it so easy, tell him that now I have eyed him
carefully, I'm quite certain that he's no more fit to command a
whale-ship than a St. Jago monkey.  In fact, tell him from me he's a
baboon."
6772	
6773	"He vows and declares, Monsieur, that the other whale, the dried one,
is far more deadly than the blasted one; in fine, Monsieur, he
conjures us, as we value our lives, to cut loose from these fish."
6774	
6775	Instantly the captain ran forward, and in a loud voice commanded his
6776	crew to desist from hoisting the cutting-tackles, and at once cast
6777	loose the cables and chains confining the whales to the ship.
6778	
6779	What now? said the Guernsey-man, when the Captain had returned to
6780	them.
6781	
6782	"Why, let me see; yes, you may as well tell him now that--that--in
fact, tell him I've diddled him, and (aside to himself) perhaps
somebody else."
6783	
6784	"He says, Monsieur, that he's very happy to have been of any service
to us."
6785	
6786	Hearing this, the captain vowed that they were the grateful parties
6787	(meaning himself and mate) and concluded by inviting Stubb down
6788	into his cabin to drink a bottle of Bordeaux.
6789	
6790	He wants you to take a glass of wine with him, said the
6791	interpreter.
6792	
6793	"Thank him heartily; but tell him it's against my principles to drink
with the man I've diddled.  In fact, tell him I must go."
6794	
6795	"He says, Monsieur, that his principles won't admit of his drinking;
but that if Monsieur wants to live another day to drink, then
Monsieur had best drop all four boats, and pull the ship away from
these whales, for it's so calm they won't drift."
6796	
6797	By this time Stubb was over the side, and getting into his boat,
6798	hailed the Guernsey-man to this effect,--that having a long tow-line
6799	in his boat, he would do what he could to help them, by pulling out
6800	the lighter whale of the two from the ship's side.  While the
6801	Frenchman's boats, then, were engaged in towing the ship one way,
6802	Stubb benevolently towed away at his whale the other way,
6803	ostentatiously slacking out a most unusually long tow-line.
6804	
6805	Presently a breeze sprang up; Stubb feigned to cast off from the
6806	whale; hoisting his boats, the Frenchman soon increased his distance,
6807	while the Pequod slid in between him and Stubb's whale.  Whereupon
6808	Stubb quickly pulled to the floating body, and hailing the Pequod to
6809	give notice of his intentions, at once proceeded to reap the fruit of
6810	his unrighteous cunning.  Seizing his sharp boat-spade, he commenced
6811	an excavation in the body, a little behind the side fin.  You would
6812	almost have thought he was digging a cellar there in the sea; and
6813	when at length his spade struck against the gaunt ribs, it was like
6814	turning up old Roman tiles and pottery buried in fat English loam.
6815	His boat's crew were all in high excitement, eagerly helping their
6816	chief, and looking as anxious as gold-hunters.
6817	
6818	And all the time numberless fowls were diving, and ducking, and
6819	screaming, and yelling, and fighting around them.  Stubb was
6820	beginning to look disappointed, especially as the horrible nosegay
6821	increased, when suddenly from out the very heart of this plague,
6822	there stole a faint stream of perfume, which flowed through the tide
6823	of bad smells without being absorbed by it, as one river will flow
6824	into and then along with another, without at all blending with it for
6825	a time.
6826	
6827	I have it, I have it, cried Stubb, with delight, striking something
6828	in the subterranean regions, a purse! a purse!
6829	
6830	Dropping his spade, he thrust both hands in, and drew out handfuls of
6831	something that looked like ripe Windsor soap, or rich mottled old
6832	cheese; very unctuous and savory withal.  You might easily dent it
6833	with your thumb; it is of a hue between yellow and ash colour.  And
6834	this, good friends, is ambergris, worth a gold guinea an ounce to any
6835	druggist.  Some six handfuls were obtained; but more was unavoidably
6836	lost in the sea, and still more, perhaps, might have been secured
6837	were it not for impatient Ahab's loud command to Stubb to desist, and
6838	come on board, else the ship would bid them good bye.
6839	
6840	
6841	
6842	CHAPTER 92
6843	
6844	Ambergris.
6845	
6846	
6847	Now this ambergris is a very curious substance, and so important as
6848	an article of commerce, that in 1791 a certain Nantucket-born Captain
6849	Coffin was examined at the bar of the English House of Commons on
6850	that subject.  For at that time, and indeed until a comparatively
6851	late day, the precise origin of ambergris remained, like amber
6852	itself, a problem to the learned.  Though the word ambergris is but
6853	the French compound for grey amber, yet the two substances are quite
6854	distinct.  For amber, though at times found on the sea-coast, is also
6855	dug up in some far inland soils, whereas ambergris is never found
6856	except upon the sea.  Besides, amber is a hard, transparent, brittle,
6857	odorless substance, used for mouth-pieces to pipes, for beads and
6858	ornaments; but ambergris is soft, waxy, and so highly fragrant and
6859	spicy, that it is largely used in perfumery, in pastiles, precious
6860	candles, hair-powders, and pomatum.  The Turks use it in cooking, and
6861	also carry it to Mecca, for the same purpose that frankincense is
6862	carried to St. Peter's in Rome.  Some wine merchants drop a few
6863	grains into claret, to flavor it.
6864	
6865	Who would think, then, that such fine ladies and gentlemen should
6866	regale themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a
6867	sick whale!  Yet so it is.  By some, ambergris is supposed to be the
6868	cause, and by others the effect, of the dyspepsia in the whale.  How
6869	to cure such a dyspepsia it were hard to say, unless by administering
6870	three or four boat loads of Brandreth's pills, and then running out
6871	of harm's way, as laborers do in blasting rocks.
6872	
6873	I have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergris,
6874	certain hard, round, bony plates, which at first Stubb thought might
6875	be sailors' trowsers buttons; but it afterwards turned out that they
6876	were nothing more than pieces of small squid bones embalmed in that
6877	manner.
6878	
6879	Now that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should be
6880	found in the heart of such decay; is this nothing?  Bethink thee of
6881	that saying of St. Paul in Corinthians, about corruption and
6882	incorruption; how that we are sown in dishonour, but raised in glory.
6883	And likewise call to mind that saying of Paracelsus about what it is
6884	that maketh the best musk.  Also forget not the strange fact that of
6885	all things of ill-savor, Cologne-water, in its rudimental
6886	manufacturing stages, is the worst.
6887	
6888	I should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal, but
6889	cannot, owing to my anxiety to repel a charge often made against
6890	whalemen, and which, in the estimation of some already biased minds,
6891	might be considered as indirectly substantiated by what has been said
6892	of the Frenchman's two whales.  Elsewhere in this volume the
6893	slanderous aspersion has been disproved, that the vocation of whaling
6894	is throughout a slatternly, untidy business.  But there is another
6895	thing to rebut.  They hint that all whales always smell bad.  Now how
6896	did this odious stigma originate?
6897	
6898	I opine, that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of the
6899	Greenland whaling ships in London, more than two centuries ago.
6900	Because those whalemen did not then, and do not now, try out their
6901	oil at sea as the Southern ships have always done; but cutting up the
6902	fresh blubber in small bits, thrust it through the bung holes of
6903	large casks, and carry it home in that manner; the shortness of the
6904	season in those Icy Seas, and the sudden and violent storms to which
6905	they are exposed, forbidding any other course.  The consequence is,
6906	that upon breaking into the hold, and unloading one of these whale
6907	cemeteries, in the Greenland dock, a savor is given forth somewhat
6908	similar to that arising from excavating an old city grave-yard, for
6909	the foundations of a Lying-in-Hospital.
6910	
6911	I partly surmise also, that this wicked charge against whalers may be
6912	likewise imputed to the existence on the coast of Greenland, in
6913	former times, of a Dutch village called Schmerenburgh or Smeerenberg,
6914	which latter name is the one used by the learned Fogo Von Slack, in
6915	his great work on Smells, a text-book on that subject.  As its name
6916	imports (smeer, fat; berg, to put up), this village was founded in
6917	order to afford a place for the blubber of the Dutch whale fleet to
6918	be tried out, without being taken home to Holland for that purpose.
6919	It was a collection of furnaces, fat-kettles, and oil sheds; and when
6920	the works were in full operation certainly gave forth no very
6921	pleasant savor.  But all this is quite different with a South Sea
6922	Sperm Whaler; which in a voyage of four years perhaps, after
6923	completely filling her hold with oil, does not, perhaps, consume
6924	fifty days in the business of boiling out; and in the state that it
6925	is casked, the oil is nearly scentless.  The truth is, that living or
6926	dead, if but decently treated, whales as a species are by no means
6927	creatures of ill odor; nor can whalemen be recognised, as the people
6928	of the middle ages affected to detect a Jew in the company, by the
6929	nose.  Nor indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise than fragrant,
6930	when, as a general thing, he enjoys such high health; taking
6931	abundance of exercise; always out of doors; though, it is true,
6932	seldom in the open air.  I say, that the motion of a Sperm Whale's
6933	flukes above water dispenses a perfume, as when a musk-scented lady
6934	rustles her dress in a warm parlor.  What then shall I liken the
6935	Sperm Whale to for fragrance, considering his magnitude?  Must it not
6936	be to that famous elephant, with jewelled tusks, and redolent with
6937	myrrh, which was led out of an Indian town to do honour to Alexander
6938	the Great?
6939	
6940	
6941	
6942	CHAPTER 93
6943	
6944	The Castaway.
6945	
6946	
6947	It was but some few days after encountering the Frenchman, that a
6948	most significant event befell the most insignificant of the Pequod's
6949	crew; an event most lamentable; and which ended in providing the
6950	sometimes madly merry and predestinated craft with a living and ever
6951	accompanying prophecy of whatever shattered sequel might prove her
6952	own.
6953	
6954	Now, in the whale ship, it is not every one that goes in the boats.
6955	Some few hands are reserved called ship-keepers, whose province it is
6956	to work the vessel while the boats are pursuing the whale.  As a
6957	general thing, these ship-keepers are as hardy fellows as the men
6958	comprising the boats' crews.  But if there happen to be an unduly
6959	slender, clumsy, or timorous wight in the ship, that wight is certain
6960	to be made a ship-keeper.  It was so in the Pequod with the little
6961	negro Pippin by nick-name, Pip by abbreviation.  Poor Pip! ye have
6962	heard of him before; ye must remember his tambourine on that dramatic
6963	midnight, so gloomy-jolly.
6964	
6965	In outer aspect, Pip and Dough-Boy made a match, like a black pony
6966	and a white one, of equal developments, though of dissimilar colour,
6967	driven in one eccentric span.  But while hapless Dough-Boy was by
6968	nature dull and torpid in his intellects, Pip, though over
6969	tender-hearted, was at bottom very bright, with that pleasant,
6970	genial, jolly brightness peculiar to his tribe; a tribe, which ever
6971	enjoy all holidays and festivities with finer, freer relish than any
6972	other race.  For blacks, the year's calendar should show naught but
6973	three hundred and sixty-five Fourth of Julys and New Year's Days.
6974	Nor smile so, while I write that this little black was brilliant, for
6975	even blackness has its brilliancy; behold yon lustrous ebony,
6976	panelled in king's cabinets.  But Pip loved life, and all life's
6977	peaceable securities; so that the panic-striking business in which he
6978	had somehow unaccountably become entrapped, had most sadly blurred
6979	his brightness; though, as ere long will be seen, what was thus
6980	temporarily subdued in him, in the end was destined to be luridly
6981	illumined by strange wild fires, that fictitiously showed him off to
6982	ten times the natural lustre with which in his native Tolland County
6983	in Connecticut, he had once enlivened many a fiddler's frolic on the
6984	green; and at melodious even-tide, with his gay ha-ha! had turned the
6985	round horizon into one star-belled tambourine.  So, though in the
6986	clear air of day, suspended against a blue-veined neck, the
6987	pure-watered diamond drop will healthful glow; yet, when the cunning
6988	jeweller would show you the diamond in its most impressive lustre, he
6989	lays it against a gloomy ground, and then lights it up, not by the
6990	sun, but by some unnatural gases.  Then come out those fiery
6991	effulgences, infernally superb; then the evil-blazing diamond, once
6992	the divinest symbol of the crystal skies, looks like some crown-jewel
6993	stolen from the King of Hell.  But let us to the story.
6994	
6995	It came to pass, that in the ambergris affair Stubb's after-oarsman
6996	chanced so to sprain his hand, as for a time to become quite maimed;
6997	and, temporarily, Pip was put into his place.
6998	
6999	The first time Stubb lowered with him, Pip evinced much nervousness;
7000	but happily, for that time, escaped close contact with the whale; and
7001	therefore came off not altogether discreditably; though Stubb
7002	observing him, took care, afterwards, to exhort him to cherish his
7003	courageousness to the utmost, for he might often find it needful.
7004	
7005	Now upon the second lowering, the boat paddled upon the whale; and as
7006	the fish received the darted iron, it gave its customary rap, which
7007	happened, in this instance, to be right under poor Pip's seat.  The
7008	involuntary consternation of the moment caused him to leap, paddle in
7009	hand, out of the boat; and in such a way, that part of the slack
7010	whale line coming against his chest, he breasted it overboard with
7011	him, so as to become entangled in it, when at last plumping into the
7012	water.  That instant the stricken whale started on a fierce run, the
7013	line swiftly straightened; and presto! poor Pip came all foaming up
7014	to the chocks of the boat, remorselessly dragged there by the line,
7015	which had taken several turns around his chest and neck.
7016	
7017	Tashtego stood in the bows.  He was full of the fire of the hunt.  He
7018	hated Pip for a poltroon.  Snatching the boat-knife from its sheath,
7019	he suspended its sharp edge over the line, and turning towards Stubb,
7020	exclaimed interrogatively, Cut?  Meantime Pip's blue, choked face
7021	plainly looked, Do, for God's sake!  All passed in a flash.  In less
7022	than half a minute, this entire thing happened.
7023	
7024	Damn him, cut! roared Stubb; and so the whale was lost and Pip was
7025	saved.
7026	
7027	So soon as he recovered himself, the poor little negro was assailed
7028	by yells and execrations from the crew.  Tranquilly permitting these
7029	irregular cursings to evaporate, Stubb then in a plain,
7030	business-like, but still half humorous manner, cursed Pip officially;
7031	and that done, unofficially gave him much wholesome advice.  The
7032	substance was, Never jump from a boat, Pip, except--but all the rest
7033	was indefinite, as the soundest advice ever is.  Now, in general,
7034	STICK TO THE BOAT, is your true motto in whaling; but cases will
7035	sometimes happen when LEAP FROM THE BOAT, is still better.  Moreover,
7036	as if perceiving at last that if he should give undiluted
7037	conscientious advice to Pip, he would be leaving him too wide a
7038	margin to jump in for the future; Stubb suddenly dropped all advice,
7039	"and concluded with a peremptory command, Stick to the boat, Pip, or
by the Lord, I won't pick you up if you jump; mind that.  We can't
afford to lose whales by the likes of you; a whale would sell for
thirty times what you would, Pip, in Alabama.  Bear that in mind, and
don't jump any more.  Hereby perhaps Stubb indirectly hinted, that"
7040	though man loved his fellow, yet man is a money-making animal, which
7041	propensity too often interferes with his benevolence.
7042	
7043	But we are all in the hands of the Gods; and Pip jumped again.  It
7044	was under very similar circumstances to the first performance; but
7045	this time he did not breast out the line; and hence, when the whale
7046	started to run, Pip was left behind on the sea, like a hurried
7047	traveller's trunk.  Alas!  Stubb was but too true to his word.  It
7048	was a beautiful, bounteous, blue day; the spangled sea calm and
7049	cool, and flatly stretching away, all round, to the horizon, like
7050	gold-beater's skin hammered out to the extremest.  Bobbing up and
7051	down in that sea, Pip's ebon head showed like a head of cloves.  No
7052	boat-knife was lifted when he fell so rapidly astern.  Stubb's
7053	inexorable back was turned upon him; and the whale was winged.  In
7054	three minutes, a whole mile of shoreless ocean was between Pip and
7055	Stubb.  Out from the centre of the sea, poor Pip turned his crisp,
7056	curling, black head to the sun, another lonely castaway, though the
7057	loftiest and the brightest.
7058	
7059	Now, in calm weather, to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the
7060	practised swimmer as to ride in a spring-carriage ashore.  But the
7061	awful lonesomeness is intolerable.  The intense concentration of self
7062	in the middle of such a heartless immensity, my God! who can tell it?
7063	Mark, how when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open sea--mark
7064	how closely they hug their ship and only coast along her sides.
7065	
7066	But had Stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate?
7067	No; he did not mean to, at least.  Because there were two boats in
7068	his wake, and he supposed, no doubt, that they would of course come
7069	up to Pip very quickly, and pick him up; though, indeed, such
7070	considerations towards oarsmen jeopardized through their own
7071	timidity, is not always manifested by the hunters in all similar
7072	instances; and such instances not unfrequently occur; almost
7073	invariably in the fishery, a coward, so called, is marked with the
7074	same ruthless detestation peculiar to military navies and armies.
7075	
7076	But it so happened, that those boats, without seeing Pip, suddenly
7077	spying whales close to them on one side, turned, and gave chase; and
7078	Stubb's boat was now so far away, and he and all his crew so intent
7079	upon his fish, that Pip's ringed horizon began to expand around him
7080	miserably.  By the merest chance the ship itself at last rescued him;
7081	but from that hour the little negro went about the deck an idiot;
7082	such, at least, they said he was.  The sea had jeeringly kept his
7083	finite body up, but drowned the infinite of his soul.  Not drowned
7084	entirely, though.  Rather carried down alive to wondrous depths,
7085	where strange shapes of the unwarped primal world glided to and fro
7086	before his passive eyes; and the miser-merman, Wisdom, revealed his
7087	hoarded heaps; and among the joyous, heartless, ever-juvenile
7088	eternities, Pip saw the multitudinous, God-omnipresent, coral
7089	insects, that out of the firmament of waters heaved the colossal
7090	orbs.  He saw God's foot upon the treadle of the loom, and spoke it;
7091	and therefore his shipmates called him mad.  So man's insanity is
7092	heaven's sense; and wandering from all mortal reason, man comes at
7093	last to that celestial thought, which, to reason, is absurd and
7094	frantic; and weal or woe, feels then uncompromised, indifferent as
7095	his God.
7096	
7097	For the rest, blame not Stubb too hardly.  The thing is common in
7098	that fishery; and in the sequel of the narrative, it will then be
7099	seen what like abandonment befell myself.

7103	CHAPTER 94
7104	
7105	A Squeeze of the Hand.
7106	
7107	
7108	That whale of Stubb's, so dearly purchased, was duly brought to the
7109	Pequod's side, where all those cutting and hoisting operations
7110	previously detailed, were regularly gone through, even to the baling
7111	of the Heidelburgh Tun, or Case.
7112	
7113	While some were occupied with this latter duty, others were employed
7114	in dragging away the larger tubs, so soon as filled with the sperm;
7115	and when the proper time arrived, this same sperm was carefully
7116	manipulated ere going to the try-works, of which anon.
7117	
7118	It had cooled and crystallized to such a degree, that when, with
7119	several others, I sat down before a large Constantine's bath of it, I
7120	found it strangely concreted into lumps, here and there rolling about
7121	in the liquid part.  It was our business to squeeze these lumps back
7122	into fluid.  A sweet and unctuous duty!  No wonder that in old times
7123	this sperm was such a favourite cosmetic.  Such a clearer! such a
7124	sweetener! such a softener! such a delicious molifier!  After
7125	having my hands in it for only a few minutes, my fingers felt like
7126	eels, and began, as it were, to serpentine and spiralise.
7127	
7128	As I sat there at my ease, cross-legged on the deck; after the bitter
7129	exertion at the windlass; under a blue tranquil sky; the ship under
7130	indolent sail, and gliding so serenely along; as I bathed my hands
7131	among those soft, gentle globules of infiltrated tissues, woven
7132	almost within the hour; as they richly broke to my fingers, and
7133	discharged all their opulence, like fully ripe grapes their wine; as
7134	I snuffed up that uncontaminated aroma,--literally and truly, like
7135	the smell of spring violets; I declare to you, that for the time I
7136	lived as in a musky meadow; I forgot all about our horrible oath; in
7137	that inexpressible sperm, I washed my hands and my heart of it; I
7138	almost began to credit the old Paracelsan superstition that sperm is
7139	of rare virtue in allaying the heat of anger; while bathing in that
7140	bath, I felt divinely free from all ill-will, or petulance, or
7141	malice, of any sort whatsoever.
7142	
7143	Squeeze! squeeze! squeeze! all the morning long; I squeezed that
7144	sperm till I myself almost melted into it; I squeezed that sperm till
7145	a strange sort of insanity came over me; and I found myself
7146	unwittingly squeezing my co-laborers' hands in it, mistaking their
7147	hands for the gentle globules.  Such an abounding, affectionate,
7148	friendly, loving feeling did this avocation beget; that at last I was
7149	continually squeezing their hands, and looking up into their eyes
7150	sentimentally; as much as to say,--Oh! my dear fellow beings, why
7151	should we longer cherish any social acerbities, or know the slightest
7152	ill-humor or envy!  Come; let us squeeze hands all round; nay, let us
7153	all squeeze ourselves into each other; let us squeeze ourselves
7154	universally into the very milk and sperm of kindness.
7155	
7156	Would that I could keep squeezing that sperm for ever!  For now,
7157	since by many prolonged, repeated experiences, I have perceived that
7158	in all cases man must eventually lower, or at least shift, his
7159	conceit of attainable felicity; not placing it anywhere in the
7160	intellect or the fancy; but in the wife, the heart, the bed, the
7161	table, the saddle, the fireside, the country; now that I have
7162	perceived all this, I am ready to squeeze case eternally.  In
7163	thoughts of the visions of the night, I saw long rows of angels in
7164	paradise, each with his hands in a jar of spermaceti.
7165	
7166	Now, while discoursing of sperm, it behooves to speak of other things
7167	akin to it, in the business of preparing the sperm whale for the
7168	try-works.
7169	
7170	First comes white-horse, so called, which is obtained from the
7171	tapering part of the fish, and also from the thicker portions of his
7172	flukes.  It is tough with congealed tendons--a wad of muscle--but
7173	still contains some oil.  After being severed from the whale, the
7174	white-horse is first cut into portable oblongs ere going to the
7175	mincer.  They look much like blocks of Berkshire marble.
7176	
7177	Plum-pudding is the term bestowed upon certain fragmentary parts of
7178	the whale's flesh, here and there adhering to the blanket of blubber,
7179	and often participating to a considerable degree in its unctuousness.
7180	It is a most refreshing, convivial, beautiful object to behold.  As
7181	its name imports, it is of an exceedingly rich, mottled tint, with a
7182	bestreaked snowy and golden ground, dotted with spots of the deepest
7183	crimson and purple.  It is plums of rubies, in pictures of citron.
7184	Spite of reason, it is hard to keep yourself from eating it.  I
7185	confess, that once I stole behind the foremast to try it.  It tasted
7186	something as I should conceive a royal cutlet from the thigh of Louis
7187	le Gros might have tasted, supposing him to have been killed the
7188	first day after the venison season, and that particular venison
7189	season contemporary with an unusually fine vintage of the vineyards
7190	of Champagne.
7191	
7192	There is another substance, and a very singular one, which turns up
7193	in the course of this business, but which I feel it to be very
7194	puzzling adequately to describe.  It is called slobgollion; an
7195	appellation original with the whalemen, and even so is the nature of
7196	the substance.  It is an ineffably oozy, stringy affair, most
7197	frequently found in the tubs of sperm, after a prolonged squeezing,
7198	and subsequent decanting.  I hold it to be the wondrously thin,
7199	ruptured membranes of the case, coalescing.
7200	
7201	Gurry, so called, is a term properly belonging to right whalemen, but
7202	sometimes incidentally used by the sperm fishermen.  It designates
7203	the dark, glutinous substance which is scraped off the back of the
7204	Greenland or right whale, and much of which covers the decks of those
7205	inferior souls who hunt that ignoble Leviathan.
7206	
7207	Nippers.  Strictly this word is not indigenous to the whale's
7208	vocabulary.  But as applied by whalemen, it becomes so.  A whaleman's
7209	nipper is a short firm strip of tendinous stuff cut from the tapering
7210	part of Leviathan's tail: it averages an inch in thickness, and for
7211	the rest, is about the size of the iron part of a hoe.  Edgewise
7212	moved along the oily deck, it operates like a leathern squilgee; and
7213	by nameless blandishments, as of magic, allures along with it all
7214	impurities.
7215	
7216	But to learn all about these recondite matters, your best way is at
7217	once to descend into the blubber-room, and have a long talk with its
7218	inmates.  This place has previously been mentioned as the receptacle
7219	for the blanket-pieces, when stript and hoisted from the whale.  When
7220	the proper time arrives for cutting up its contents, this apartment
7221	is a scene of terror to all tyros, especially by night.  On one side,
7222	lit by a dull lantern, a space has been left clear for the workmen.
7223	They generally go in pairs,--a pike-and-gaffman and a spade-man.
7224	The whaling-pike is similar to a frigate's boarding-weapon of the
7225	same name.  The gaff is something like a boat-hook.  With his gaff,
7226	the gaffman hooks on to a sheet of blubber, and strives to hold it
7227	from slipping, as the ship pitches and lurches about.  Meanwhile, the
7228	spade-man stands on the sheet itself, perpendicularly chopping it
7229	into the portable horse-pieces.  This spade is sharp as hone can make
7230	it; the spademan's feet are shoeless; the thing he stands on will
7231	sometimes irresistibly slide away from him, like a sledge.  If he
7232	cuts off one of his own toes, or one of his assistants', would you be
7233	very much astonished?  Toes are scarce among veteran blubber-room
7234	men.

7239	
7240	The Cassock.
7241	
7242	
7243	Had you stepped on board the Pequod at a certain juncture of this
7244	post-mortemizing of the whale; and had you strolled forward nigh the
7245	windlass, pretty sure am I that you would have scanned with no small
7246	curiosity a very strange, enigmatical object, which you would have
7247	seen there, lying along lengthwise in the lee scuppers.  Not the
7248	wondrous cistern in the whale's huge head; not the prodigy of his
7249	unhinged lower jaw; not the miracle of his symmetrical tail; none of
7250	these would so surprise you, as half a glimpse of that unaccountable
7251	cone,--longer than a Kentuckian is tall, nigh a foot in diameter at
7252	the base, and jet-black as Yojo, the ebony idol of Queequeg.  And an
7253	idol, indeed, it is; or, rather, in old times, its likeness was.
7254	Such an idol as that found in the secret groves of Queen Maachah in
7255	Judea; and for worshipping which, King Asa, her son, did depose her,
7256	and destroyed the idol, and burnt it for an abomination at the brook
7257	Kedron, as darkly set forth in the 15th chapter of the First Book of
7258	Kings.
7259	
7260	Look at the sailor, called the mincer, who now comes along, and
7261	assisted by two allies, heavily backs the grandissimus, as the
7262	mariners call it, and with bowed shoulders, staggers off with it as
7263	if he were a grenadier carrying a dead comrade from the field.
7264	Extending it upon the forecastle deck, he now proceeds cylindrically
7265	to remove its dark pelt, as an African hunter the pelt of a boa.
7266	This done he turns the pelt inside out, like a pantaloon leg; gives
7267	it a good stretching, so as almost to double its diameter; and at
7268	last hangs it, well spread, in the rigging, to dry.  Ere long, it is
7269	taken down; when removing some three feet of it, towards the pointed
7270	extremity, and then cutting two slits for arm-holes at the other end,
7271	he lengthwise slips himself bodily into it.  The mincer now stands
7272	before you invested in the full canonicals of his calling.
7273	Immemorial to all his order, this investiture alone will adequately
7274	protect him, while employed in the peculiar functions of his office.
7275	
7276	That office consists in mincing the horse-pieces of blubber for the
7277	pots; an operation which is conducted at a curious wooden horse,
7278	planted endwise against the bulwarks, and with a capacious tub
7279	beneath it, into which the minced pieces drop, fast as the sheets
7280	from a rapt orator's desk.  Arrayed in decent black; occupying a
7281	conspicuous pulpit; intent on bible leaves; what a candidate for an
7282	archbishopric, what a lad for a Pope were this mincer!*
7283	
7284	
7285	*Bible leaves!  Bible leaves!  This is the invariable cry from the
7286	mates to the mincer.  It enjoins him to be careful, and cut his work
7287	into as thin slices as possible, inasmuch as by so doing the business
7288	of boiling out the oil is much accelerated, and its quantity
7289	considerably increased, besides perhaps improving it in quality.
7290	
7291	
7292	
7293	CHAPTER 96
7294	
7295	The Try-Works.
7296	
7297	
7298	Besides her hoisted boats, an American whaler is outwardly
7299	distinguished by her try-works.  She presents the curious anomaly of
7300	the most solid masonry joining with oak and hemp in constituting the
7301	completed ship.  It is as if from the open field a brick-kiln were
7302	transported to her planks.
7303	
7304	The try-works are planted between the foremast and mainmast, the
7305	most roomy part of the deck.  The timbers beneath are of a peculiar
7306	strength, fitted to sustain the weight of an almost solid mass of
7307	brick and mortar, some ten feet by eight square, and five in height.
7308	The foundation does not penetrate the deck, but the masonry is firmly
7309	secured to the surface by ponderous knees of iron bracing it on all
7310	sides, and screwing it down to the timbers.  On the flanks it is
7311	cased with wood, and at top completely covered by a large, sloping,
7312	battened hatchway.  Removing this hatch we expose the great try-pots,
7313	two in number, and each of several barrels' capacity.  When not in
7314	use, they are kept remarkably clean.  Sometimes they are polished
7315	with soapstone and sand, till they shine within like silver
7316	punch-bowls.  During the night-watches some cynical old sailors will
7317	crawl into them and coil themselves away there for a nap.  While
7318	employed in polishing them--one man in each pot, side by side--many
7319	confidential communications are carried on, over the iron lips.  It
7320	is a place also for profound mathematical meditation.  It was in the
7321	left hand try-pot of the Pequod, with the soapstone diligently
7322	circling round me, that I was first indirectly struck by the
7323	remarkable fact, that in geometry all bodies gliding along the
7324	cycloid, my soapstone for example, will descend from any point in
7325	precisely the same time.
7326	
7327	Removing the fire-board from the front of the try-works, the bare
7328	masonry of that side is exposed, penetrated by the two iron mouths of
7329	the furnaces, directly underneath the pots.  These mouths are fitted
7330	with heavy doors of iron.  The intense heat of the fire is prevented
7331	from communicating itself to the deck, by means of a shallow
7332	reservoir extending under the entire inclosed surface of the works.
7333	By a tunnel inserted at the rear, this reservoir is kept replenished
7334	with water as fast as it evaporates.  There are no external chimneys;
7335	they open direct from the rear wall.  And here let us go back for a
7336	moment.
7337	
7338	It was about nine o'clock at night that the Pequod's try-works were
7339	first started on this present voyage.  It belonged to Stubb to
7340	oversee the business.
7341	
7342	"All ready there?  Off hatch, then, and start her.  You cook, fire
the works.  This was an easy thing, for the carpenter had been"
7343	thrusting his shavings into the furnace throughout the passage.  Here
7344	be it said that in a whaling voyage the first fire in the try-works has
7345	to be fed for a time with wood.  After that no wood is used, except
7346	as a means of quick ignition to the staple fuel.  In a word, after
7347	being tried out, the crisp, shrivelled blubber, now called scraps or
7348	fritters, still contains considerable of its unctuous properties.
7349	These fritters feed the flames.  Like a plethoric burning martyr, or
7350	a self-consuming misanthrope, once ignited, the whale supplies his
7351	own fuel and burns by his own body.  Would that he consumed his own
7352	smoke! for his smoke is horrible to inhale, and inhale it you must,
7353	and not only that, but you must live in it for the time.  It has an
7354	unspeakable, wild, Hindoo odor about it, such as may lurk in the
7355	vicinity of funereal pyres.  It smells like the left wing of the day
7356	of judgment; it is an argument for the pit.
7357	
7358	By midnight the works were in full operation.  We were clear from the
7359	carcase; sail had been made; the wind was freshening; the wild ocean
7360	darkness was intense.  But that darkness was licked up by the fierce
7361	flames, which at intervals forked forth from the sooty flues, and
7362	illuminated every lofty rope in the rigging, as with the famed Greek
7363	fire.  The burning ship drove on, as if remorselessly commissioned to
7364	some vengeful deed.  So the pitch and sulphur-freighted brigs of the
7365	bold Hydriote, Canaris, issuing from their midnight harbors, with
7366	broad sheets of flame for sails, bore down upon the Turkish frigates,
7367	and folded them in conflagrations.
7368	
7369	The hatch, removed from the top of the works, now afforded a wide
7370	hearth in front of them.  Standing on this were the Tartarean shapes
7371	of the pagan harpooneers, always the whale-ship's stokers.  With huge
7372	pronged poles they pitched hissing masses of blubber into the
7373	scalding pots, or stirred up the fires beneath, till the snaky flames
7374	darted, curling, out of the doors to catch them by the feet.  The
7375	smoke rolled away in sullen heaps.  To every pitch of the ship there
7376	was a pitch of the boiling oil, which seemed all eagerness to leap
7377	into their faces.  Opposite the mouth of the works, on the further
7378	side of the wide wooden hearth, was the windlass.  This served for a
7379	sea-sofa.  Here lounged the watch, when not otherwise employed,
7380	looking into the red heat of the fire, till their eyes felt scorched
7381	in their heads.  Their tawny features, now all begrimed with smoke
7382	and sweat, their matted beards, and the contrasting barbaric
7383	brilliancy of their teeth, all these were strangely revealed in the
7384	capricious emblazonings of the works.  As they narrated to each other
7385	their unholy adventures, their tales of terror told in words of
7386	mirth; as their uncivilized laughter forked upwards out of them, like
7387	the flames from the furnace; as to and fro, in their front, the
7388	harpooneers wildly gesticulated with their huge pronged forks and
7389	dippers; as the wind howled on, and the sea leaped, and the ship
7390	groaned and dived, and yet steadfastly shot her red hell further and
7391	further into the blackness of the sea and the night, and scornfully
7392	champed the white bone in her mouth, and viciously spat round her on
7393	all sides; then the rushing Pequod, freighted with savages, and laden
7394	with fire, and burning a corpse, and plunging into that blackness of
7395	darkness, seemed the material counterpart of her monomaniac
7396	commander's soul.
7397	
7398	So seemed it to me, as I stood at her helm, and for long hours
7399	silently guided the way of this fire-ship on the sea.  Wrapped, for
7400	that interval, in darkness myself, I but the better saw the redness,
7401	the madness, the ghastliness of others.  The continual sight of the
7402	fiend shapes before me, capering half in smoke and half in fire,
7403	these at last begat kindred visions in my soul, so soon as I began to
7404	yield to that unaccountable drowsiness which ever would come over me
7405	at a midnight helm.
7406	
7407	But that night, in particular, a strange (and ever since
7408	inexplicable) thing occurred to me.  Starting from a brief standing
7409	sleep, I was horribly conscious of something fatally wrong.  The
7410	jaw-bone tiller smote my side, which leaned against it; in my ears
7411	was the low hum of sails, just beginning to shake in the wind; I
7412	thought my eyes were open; I was half conscious of putting my fingers
7413	to the lids and mechanically stretching them still further apart.
7414	But, spite of all this, I could see no compass before me to steer by;
7415	though it seemed but a minute since I had been watching the card, by
7416	the steady binnacle lamp illuminating it.  Nothing seemed before me
7417	but a jet gloom, now and then made ghastly by flashes of redness.
7418	Uppermost was the impression, that whatever swift, rushing thing I
7419	stood on was not so much bound to any haven ahead as rushing from all
7420	havens astern.  A stark, bewildered feeling, as of death, came over
7421	me.  Convulsively my hands grasped the tiller, but with the crazy
7422	conceit that the tiller was, somehow, in some enchanted way,
7423	inverted.  My God! what is the matter with me? thought I.  Lo! in my
7424	brief sleep I had turned myself about, and was fronting the ship's
7425	stern, with my back to her prow and the compass.  In an instant I
7426	faced back, just in time to prevent the vessel from flying up into
7427	the wind, and very probably capsizing her.  How glad and how grateful
7428	the relief from this unnatural hallucination of the night, and the
7429	fatal contingency of being brought by the lee!
7430	
7431	Look not too long in the face of the fire, O man!  Never dream with
7432	thy hand on the helm!  Turn not thy back to the compass; accept the
7433	first hint of the hitching tiller; believe not the artificial fire,
7434	when its redness makes all things look ghastly.  To-morrow, in the
7435	natural sun, the skies will be bright; those who glared like devils
7436	in the forking flames, the morn will show in far other, at least
7437	gentler, relief; the glorious, golden, glad sun, the only true
7438	lamp--all others but liars!
7439	
7440	Nevertheless the sun hides not Virginia's Dismal Swamp, nor Rome's
7441	accursed Campagna, nor wide Sahara, nor all the millions of miles of
7442	deserts and of griefs beneath the moon.  The sun hides not the ocean,
7443	which is the dark side of this earth, and which is two thirds of this
7444	earth.  So, therefore, that mortal man who hath more of joy than
7445	sorrow in him, that mortal man cannot be true--not true, or
7446	undeveloped.  With books the same.  The truest of all men was the Man
7447	of Sorrows, and the truest of all books is Solomon's, and
7448	Ecclesiastes is the fine hammered steel of woe.  All is vanity.
7449	ALL.  This wilful world hath not got hold of unchristian Solomon's
7450	wisdom yet.  But he who dodges hospitals and jails, and walks fast
7451	crossing graveyards, and would rather talk of operas than hell;
7452	calls Cowper, Young, Pascal, Rousseau, poor devils all of sick men;
7453	and throughout a care-free lifetime swears by Rabelais as passing
7454	wise, and therefore jolly;--not that man is fitted to sit down on
7455	tomb-stones, and break the green damp mould with unfathomably
7456	wondrous Solomon.
7457	
7458	"But even Solomon, he says, the man that wandereth out of the way of
understanding shall remain (I.E., even while living) in the
congregation of the dead.  Give not thyself up, then, to fire, lest"
7459	it invert thee, deaden thee; as for the time it did me.  There is a
7460	wisdom that is woe; but there is a woe that is madness.  And there is
7461	a Catskill eagle in some souls that can alike dive down into the
7462	blackest gorges, and soar out of them again and become invisible in
7463	the sunny spaces.  And even if he for ever flies within the gorge,
7464	that gorge is in the mountains; so that even in his lowest swoop the
7465	mountain eagle is still higher than other birds upon the plain, even
7466	though they soar.
7467

7470	CHAPTER 97
7471	
7472	The Lamp.
7473	
7474	
7475	Had you descended from the Pequod's try-works to the Pequod's
7476	forecastle, where the off duty watch were sleeping, for one single
7477	moment you would have almost thought you were standing in some
7478	illuminated shrine of canonized kings and counsellors.  There they
7479	lay in their triangular oaken vaults, each mariner a chiselled
7480	muteness; a score of lamps flashing upon his hooded eyes.
7481	
7482	In merchantmen, oil for the sailor is more scarce than the milk of
7483	queens.  To dress in the dark, and eat in the dark, and stumble in
7484	darkness to his pallet, this is his usual lot.  But the whaleman, as
7485	he seeks the food of light, so he lives in light.  He makes his berth
7486	an Aladdin's lamp, and lays him down in it; so that in the pitchiest
7487	night the ship's black hull still houses an illumination.
7488	
7489	See with what entire freedom the whaleman takes his handful of
7490	lamps--often but old bottles and vials, though--to the copper cooler
7491	at the try-works, and replenishes them there, as mugs of ale at a
7492	vat.  He burns, too, the purest of oil, in its unmanufactured, and,
7493	therefore, unvitiated state; a fluid unknown to solar, lunar, or
7494	astral contrivances ashore.  It is sweet as early grass butter in
7495	April.  He goes and hunts for his oil, so as to be sure of its
7496	freshness and genuineness, even as the traveller on the prairie hunts
7497	up his own supper of game.

7501	CHAPTER 98
7502	
7503	Stowing Down and Clearing Up.
7504	
7505	
7506	Already has it been related how the great leviathan is afar off
7507	descried from the mast-head; how he is chased over the watery moors,
7508	and slaughtered in the valleys of the deep; how he is then towed
7509	alongside and beheaded; and how (on the principle which entitled the
7510	headsman of old to the garments in which the beheaded was killed) his
7511	great padded surtout becomes the property of his executioner; how, in
7512	due time, he is condemned to the pots, and, like Shadrach, Meshach,
7513	and Abednego, his spermaceti, oil, and bone pass unscathed through
7514	the fire;--but now it remains to conclude the last chapter of this
7515	part of the description by rehearsing--singing, if I may--the
7516	romantic proceeding of decanting off his oil into the casks and
7517	striking them down into the hold, where once again leviathan returns
7518	to his native profundities, sliding along beneath the surface as
7519	before; but, alas! never more to rise and blow.
7520	
7521	While still warm, the oil, like hot punch, is received into the
7522	six-barrel casks; and while, perhaps, the ship is pitching and
7523	rolling this way and that in the midnight sea, the enormous casks are
7524	slewed round and headed over, end for end, and sometimes perilously
7525	scoot across the slippery deck, like so many land slides, till at
7526	last man-handled and stayed in their course; and all round the hoops,
7527	rap, rap, go as many hammers as can play upon them, for now, EX
7528	OFFICIO, every sailor is a cooper.
7529	
7530	At length, when the last pint is casked, and all is cool, then the
7531	great hatchways are unsealed, the bowels of the ship are thrown open,
7532	and down go the casks to their final rest in the sea.  This done, the
7533	hatches are replaced, and hermetically closed, like a closet walled
7534	up.
7535	
7536	In the sperm fishery, this is perhaps one of the most remarkable
7537	incidents in all the business of whaling.  One day the planks stream
7538	with freshets of blood and oil; on the sacred quarter-deck enormous
7539	masses of the whale's head are profanely piled; great rusty casks lie
7540	about, as in a brewery yard; the smoke from the try-works has
7541	besooted all the bulwarks; the mariners go about suffused with
7542	unctuousness; the entire ship seems great leviathan himself; while on
7543	all hands the din is deafening.
7544	
7545	But a day or two after, you look about you, and prick your ears in
7546	this self-same ship; and were it not for the tell-tale boats and
7547	try-works, you would all but swear you trod some silent merchant
7548	vessel, with a most scrupulously neat commander.  The unmanufactured
7549	sperm oil possesses a singularly cleansing virtue.  This is the
7550	reason why the decks never look so white as just after what they call
7551	an affair of oil.  Besides, from the ashes of the burned scraps of
7552	the whale, a potent lye is readily made; and whenever any
7553	adhesiveness from the back of the whale remains clinging to the side,
7554	that lye quickly exterminates it.  Hands go diligently along the
7555	bulwarks, and with buckets of water and rags restore them to their
7556	full tidiness.  The soot is brushed from the lower rigging.  All the
7557	numerous implements which have been in use are likewise faithfully
7558	cleansed and put away.  The great hatch is scrubbed and placed upon
7559	the try-works, completely hiding the pots; every cask is out of
7560	sight; all tackles are coiled in unseen nooks; and when by the
7561	combined and simultaneous industry of almost the entire ship's
7562	company, the whole of this conscientious duty is at last concluded,
7563	then the crew themselves proceed to their own ablutions; shift
7564	themselves from top to toe; and finally issue to the immaculate deck,
7565	fresh and all aglow, as bridegrooms new-leaped from out the daintiest
7566	Holland.
7567	
7568	Now, with elated step, they pace the planks in twos and threes, and
7569	humorously discourse of parlors, sofas, carpets, and fine cambrics;
7570	propose to mat the deck; think of having hanging to the top; object
7571	not to taking tea by moonlight on the piazza of the forecastle.  To
7572	hint to such musked mariners of oil, and bone, and blubber, were
7573	little short of audacity.  They know not the thing you distantly
7574	allude to.  Away, and bring us napkins!
7575	
7576	But mark: aloft there, at the three mast heads, stand three men
7577	intent on spying out more whales, which, if caught, infallibly will
7578	again soil the old oaken furniture, and drop at least one small
7579	grease-spot somewhere.  Yes; and many is the time, when, after the
7580	severest uninterrupted labors, which know no night; continuing
7581	straight through for ninety-six hours; when from the boat, where they
7582	have swelled their wrists with all day rowing on the Line,--they only
7583	step to the deck to carry vast chains, and heave the heavy windlass,
7584	and cut and slash, yea, and in their very sweatings to be smoked and
7585	burned anew by the combined fires of the equatorial sun and the
7586	equatorial try-works; when, on the heel of all this, they have
7587	finally bestirred themselves to cleanse the ship, and make a spotless
7588	dairy room of it; many is the time the poor fellows, just buttoning
7589	"the necks of their clean frocks, are startled by the cry of There
she blows! and away they fly to fight another whale, and go through"
7590	the whole weary thing again.  Oh! my friends, but this is
7591	man-killing!  Yet this is life.  For hardly have we mortals by long
7592	toilings extracted from this world's vast bulk its small but
7593	valuable sperm; and then, with weary patience, cleansed ourselves
7594	from its defilements, and learned to live here in clean tabernacles
7595	of the soul; hardly is this done, when--THERE SHE BLOWS!--the ghost
7596	is spouted up, and away we sail to fight some other world, and go
7597	through young life's old routine again.
7598	
7599	Oh! the metempsychosis!  Oh!  Pythagoras, that in bright Greece, two
7600	thousand years ago, did die, so good, so wise, so mild; I sailed with
7601	thee along the Peruvian coast last voyage--and, foolish as I am,
7602	taught thee, a green simple boy, how to splice a rope!
7603	
7604	
7605	
7606	CHAPTER 99
7607	
7608	The Doubloon.
7609	
7610	
7611	Ere now it has been related how Ahab was wont to pace his
7612	quarter-deck, taking regular turns at either limit, the binnacle and
7613	mainmast; but in the multiplicity of other things requiring narration
7614	it has not been added how that sometimes in these walks, when most
7615	plunged in his mood, he was wont to pause in turn at each spot, and
7616	stand there strangely eyeing the particular object before him.  When
7617	he halted before the binnacle, with his glance fastened on the
7618	pointed needle in the compass, that glance shot like a javelin with
7619	the pointed intensity of his purpose; and when resuming his walk he
7620	again paused before the mainmast, then, as the same riveted glance
7621	fastened upon the riveted gold coin there, he still wore the same
7622	aspect of nailed firmness, only dashed with a certain wild longing,
7623	if not hopefulness.
7624	
7625	But one morning, turning to pass the doubloon, he seemed to be newly
7626	attracted by the strange figures and inscriptions stamped on it, as
7627	though now for the first time beginning to interpret for himself in
7628	some monomaniac way whatever significance might lurk in them.  And
7629	some certain significance lurks in all things, else all things are
7630	little worth, and the round world itself but an empty cipher, except
7631	to sell by the cartload, as they do hills about Boston, to fill up
7632	some morass in the Milky Way.
7633	
7634	Now this doubloon was of purest, virgin gold, raked somewhere out of
7635	the heart of gorgeous hills, whence, east and west, over golden
7636	sands, the head-waters of many a Pactolus flows.  And though now
7637	nailed amidst all the rustiness of iron bolts and the verdigris of
7638	copper spikes, yet, untouchable and immaculate to any foulness, it
7639	still preserved its Quito glow.  Nor, though placed amongst a
7640	ruthless crew and every hour passed by ruthless hands, and through
7641	the livelong nights shrouded with thick darkness which might cover
7642	any pilfering approach, nevertheless every sunrise found the doubloon
7643	where the sunset left it last.  For it was set apart and sanctified
7644	to one awe-striking end; and however wanton in their sailor ways, one
7645	and all, the mariners revered it as the white whale's talisman.
7646	Sometimes they talked it over in the weary watch by night, wondering
7647	whose it was to be at last, and whether he would ever live to spend
7648	it.
7649	
7650	Now those noble golden coins of South America are as medals of the
7651	sun and tropic token-pieces.  Here palms, alpacas, and volcanoes;
7652	sun's disks and stars; ecliptics, horns-of-plenty, and rich banners
7653	waving, are in luxuriant profusion stamped; so that the precious gold
7654	seems almost to derive an added preciousness and enhancing glories,
7655	by passing through those fancy mints, so Spanishly poetic.
7656	
7657	It so chanced that the doubloon of the Pequod was a most wealthy
7658	example of these things.  On its round border it bore the letters,
7659	REPUBLICA DEL ECUADOR: QUITO.  So this bright coin came from a
7660	country planted in the middle of the world, and beneath the great
7661	equator, and named after it; and it had been cast midway up the
7662	Andes, in the unwaning clime that knows no autumn.  Zoned by those
7663	letters you saw the likeness of three Andes' summits; from one a
7664	flame; a tower on another; on the third a crowing cock; while arching
7665	over all was a segment of the partitioned zodiac, the signs all
7666	marked with their usual cabalistics, and the keystone sun entering
7667	the equinoctial point at Libra.
7668	
7669	Before this equatorial coin, Ahab, not unobserved by others, was now
7670	pausing.
7671	
7672	"There's something ever egotistical in mountain-tops and towers, and
all other grand and lofty things; look here,--three peaks as proud as
Lucifer.  The firm tower, that is Ahab; the volcano, that is Ahab;
the courageous, the undaunted, and victorious fowl, that, too, is
Ahab; all are Ahab; and this round gold is but the image of the
rounder globe, which, like a magician's glass, to each and every man
in turn but mirrors back his own mysterious self.  Great pains, small
gains for those who ask the world to solve them; it cannot solve
itself.  Methinks now this coined sun wears a ruddy face; but see!
aye, he enters the sign of storms, the equinox! and but six months
before he wheeled out of a former equinox at Aries!  From storm to
storm!  So be it, then.  Born in throes, 't is fit that man should
live in pains and die in pangs!  So be it, then!  Here's stout stuff
for woe to work on.  So be it, then."
7673	
7674	"No fairy fingers can have pressed the gold, but devil's claws must have
left their mouldings there since yesterday, murmured Starbuck to"
7675	"himself, leaning against the bulwarks.  The old man seems to read
Belshazzar's awful writing.  I have never marked the coin
inspectingly.  He goes below; let me read.  A dark valley between
three mighty, heaven-abiding peaks, that almost seem the Trinity, in
some faint earthly symbol.  So in this vale of Death, God girds us
round; and over all our gloom, the sun of Righteousness still shines
a beacon and a hope.  If we bend down our eyes, the dark vale shows
her mouldy soil; but if we lift them, the bright sun meets our glance
half way, to cheer.  Yet, oh, the great sun is no fixture; and if, at
midnight, we would fain snatch some sweet solace from him, we gaze
for him in vain!  This coin speaks wisely, mildly, truly, but still
sadly to me.  I will quit it, lest Truth shake me falsely."
7676	
7677	There now's the old Mogul, soliloquized Stubb by the try-works,
7678	"he's been twigging it; and there goes Starbuck from the same, and
both with faces which I should say might be somewhere within nine
fathoms long.  And all from looking at a piece of gold, which did I
have it now on Negro Hill or in Corlaer's Hook, I'd not look at it
very long ere spending it.  Humph! in my poor, insignificant opinion,
I regard this as queer.  I have seen doubloons before now in my
voyagings; your doubloons of old Spain, your doubloons of Peru, your
doubloons of Chili, your doubloons of Bolivia, your doubloons of
Popayan; with plenty of gold moidores and pistoles, and joes, and
half joes, and quarter joes.  What then should there be in this
doubloon of the Equator that is so killing wonderful?  By Golconda!
let me read it once.  Halloa! here's signs and wonders truly!  That,
now, is what old Bowditch in his Epitome calls the zodiac, and what
my almanac below calls ditto.  I'll get the almanac and as I have
heard devils can be raised with Daboll's arithmetic, I'll try my hand
at raising a meaning out of these queer curvicues here with the
Massachusetts calendar.  Here's the book.  Let's see now.  Signs and
wonders; and the sun, he's always among 'em.  Hem, hem, hem; here
they are--here they go--all alive:--Aries, or the Ram; Taurus, or the
Bull and Jimimi! here's Gemini himself, or the Twins.  Well; the sun
he wheels among 'em.  Aye, here on the coin he's just crossing the
threshold between two of twelve sitting-rooms all in a ring.  Book!
you lie there; the fact is, you books must know your places.  You'll
do to give us the bare words and facts, but we come in to supply the
thoughts.  That's my small experience, so far as the Massachusetts
calendar, and Bowditch's navigator, and Daboll's arithmetic go.
Signs and wonders, eh?  Pity if there is nothing wonderful in signs,
and significant in wonders!  There's a clue somewhere; wait a bit;
hist--hark!  By Jove, I have it!  Look you, Doubloon, your zodiac
here is the life of man in one round chapter; and now I'll read it
off, straight out of the book.  Come, Almanack!  To begin: there's
Aries, or the Ram--lecherous dog, he begets us; then, Taurus, or the
Bull--he bumps us the first thing; then Gemini, or the Twins--that
is, Virtue and Vice; we try to reach Virtue, when lo! comes Cancer
the Crab, and drags us back; and here, going from Virtue, Leo, a
roaring Lion, lies in the path--he gives a few fierce bites and surly
dabs with his paw; we escape, and hail Virgo, the Virgin! that's our
first love; we marry and think to be happy for aye, when pop comes
Libra, or the Scales--happiness weighed and found wanting; and while
we are very sad about that, Lord! how we suddenly jump, as Scorpio,
or the Scorpion, stings us in the rear; we are curing the wound, when
whang come the arrows all round; Sagittarius, or the Archer, is
amusing himself.  As we pluck out the shafts, stand aside! here's
the battering-ram, Capricornus, or the Goat; full tilt, he comes
rushing, and headlong we are tossed; when Aquarius, or the
Water-bearer, pours out his whole deluge and drowns us; and to wind
up with Pisces, or the Fishes, we sleep.  There's a sermon now, writ
in high heaven, and the sun goes through it every year, and yet comes
out of it all alive and hearty.  Jollily he, aloft there, wheels
through toil and trouble; and so, alow here, does jolly Stubb.  Oh,
jolly's the word for aye!  Adieu, Doubloon!  But stop; here comes
little King-Post; dodge round the try-works, now, and let's hear what
he'll have to say.  There; he's before it; he'll out with something
presently.  So, so; he's beginning."
7679	
7680	"I see nothing here, but a round thing made of gold, and whoever
raises a certain whale, this round thing belongs to him.  So, what's
all this staring been about?  It is worth sixteen dollars, that's
true; and at two cents the cigar, that's nine hundred and sixty
cigars.  I won't smoke dirty pipes like Stubb, but I like cigars, and
here's nine hundred and sixty of them; so here goes Flask aloft to
spy 'em out."
7681	
7682	"Shall I call that wise or foolish, now; if it be really wise it has
a foolish look to it; yet, if it be really foolish, then has it a
sort of wiseish look to it.  But, avast; here comes our old
Manxman--the old hearse-driver, he must have been, that is, before he
took to the sea.  He luffs up before the doubloon; halloa, and goes
round on the other side of the mast; why, there's a horse-shoe nailed
on that side; and now he's back again; what does that mean?  Hark!
he's muttering--voice like an old worn-out coffee-mill.  Prick ears,
and listen!"
7683	
7684	"If the White Whale be raised, it must be in a month and a day, when
the sun stands in some one of these signs.  I've studied signs, and
know their marks; they were taught me two score years ago, by the old
witch in Copenhagen.  Now, in what sign will the sun then be?  The
horse-shoe sign; for there it is, right opposite the gold.  And
what's the horse-shoe sign?  The lion is the horse-shoe sign--the
roaring and devouring lion.  Ship, old ship! my old head shakes to
think of thee."
7685	
7686	"There's another rendering now; but still one text.  All sorts of men
in one kind of world, you see.  Dodge again! here comes Queequeg--all
tattooing--looks like the signs of the Zodiac himself.  What says the
Cannibal?  As I live he's comparing notes; looking at his thigh bone;
thinks the sun is in the thigh, or in the calf, or in the bowels, I
suppose, as the old women talk Surgeon's Astronomy in the back
country.  And by Jove, he's found something there in the vicinity of
his thigh--I guess it's Sagittarius, or the Archer.  No: he don't
know what to make of the doubloon; he takes it for an old button off
some king's trowsers.  But, aside again! here comes that ghost-devil,
Fedallah; tail coiled out of sight as usual, oakum in the toes of his
pumps as usual.  What does he say, with that look of his?  Ah, only
makes a sign to the sign and bows himself; there is a sun on the
coin--fire worshipper, depend upon it.  Ho! more and more.  This way
comes Pip--poor boy! would he had died, or I; he's half horrible to
me.  He too has been watching all of these interpreters--myself
included--and look now, he comes to read, with that unearthly idiot
face.  Stand away again and hear him.  Hark!"
7687	
7688	I look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look.
7689	
7690	"Upon my soul, he's been studying Murray's Grammar!  Improving his
mind, poor fellow!  But what's that he says now--hist!"
7691	
7692	I look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look.
7693	
7694	Why, he's getting it by heart--hist! again.
7695	
7696	I look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look.
7697	
7698	Well, that's funny.
7699	
7700	"And I, you, and he; and we, ye, and they, are all bats; and I'm a
crow, especially when I stand a'top of this pine tree here.  Caw!
caw! caw! caw! caw! caw!  Ain't I a crow?  And where's the
scare-crow?  There he stands; two bones stuck into a pair of old
trowsers, and two more poked into the sleeves of an old jacket."
7701	
7702	"Wonder if he means me?--complimentary!--poor lad!--I could go hang
myself.  Any way, for the present, I'll quit Pip's vicinity.  I can
stand the rest, for they have plain wits; but he's too crazy-witty
for my sanity.  So, so, I leave him muttering."
7703	
7704	"Here's the ship's navel, this doubloon here, and they are all on
fire to unscrew it.  But, unscrew your navel, and what's the
consequence?  Then again, if it stays here, that is ugly, too, for
when aught's nailed to the mast it's a sign that things grow
desperate.  Ha, ha! old Ahab! the White Whale; he'll nail ye!  This
is a pine tree.  My father, in old Tolland county, cut down a pine
tree once, and found a silver ring grown over in it; some old
darkey's wedding ring.  How did it get there?  And so they'll say in
the resurrection, when they come to fish up this old mast, and find a
doubloon lodged in it, with bedded oysters for the shaggy bark.  Oh,
the gold! the precious, precious, gold! the green miser'll hoard ye
soon!  Hish! hish!  God goes 'mong the worlds blackberrying.  Cook!
ho, cook! and cook us!  Jenny! hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, Jenny, Jenny!
and get your hoe-cake done!"

7708	CHAPTER 100
7709	
7710	Leg and Arm.
7711	
7712	The Pequod, of Nantucket, Meets the Samuel Enderby, of London.
7713	
7714	
7715	Ship, ahoy!  Hast seen the White Whale?
7716	
7717	So cried Ahab, once more hailing a ship showing English colours,
7718	bearing down under the stern.  Trumpet to mouth, the old man was
7719	standing in his hoisted quarter-boat, his ivory leg plainly revealed
7720	to the stranger captain, who was carelessly reclining in his own
7721	boat's bow.  He was a darkly-tanned, burly, good-natured,
7722	fine-looking man, of sixty or thereabouts, dressed in a spacious
7723	roundabout, that hung round him in festoons of blue pilot-cloth; and
7724	one empty arm of this jacket streamed behind him like the broidered
7725	arm of a hussar's surcoat.
7726	
7727	Hast seen the White Whale!
7728	
7729	See you this? and withdrawing it from the folds that had hidden
7730	it, he held up a white arm of sperm whale bone, terminating in a
7731	wooden head like a mallet.
7732	
7733	Man my boat! cried Ahab, impetuously, and tossing about the oars
7734	near him--Stand by to lower!
7735	
7736	In less than a minute, without quitting his little craft, he and his
7737	crew were dropped to the water, and were soon alongside of the
7738	stranger.  But here a curious difficulty presented itself.  In the
7739	excitement of the moment, Ahab had forgotten that since the loss of
7740	his leg he had never once stepped on board of any vessel at sea but
7741	his own, and then it was always by an ingenious and very handy
7742	mechanical contrivance peculiar to the Pequod, and a thing not to be
7743	rigged and shipped in any other vessel at a moment's warning.  Now,
7744	it is no very easy matter for anybody--except those who are almost
7745	hourly used to it, like whalemen--to clamber up a ship's side from a
7746	boat on the open sea; for the great swells now lift the boat high up
7747	towards the bulwarks, and then instantaneously drop it half way down
7748	to the kelson.  So, deprived of one leg, and the strange ship of
7749	course being altogether unsupplied with the kindly invention, Ahab
7750	now found himself abjectly reduced to a clumsy landsman again;
7751	hopelessly eyeing the uncertain changeful height he could hardly hope
7752	to attain.
7753	
7754	It has before been hinted, perhaps, that every little untoward
7755	circumstance that befell him, and which indirectly sprang from his
7756	luckless mishap, almost invariably irritated or exasperated Ahab.
7757	And in the present instance, all this was heightened by the sight of
7758	the two officers of the strange ship, leaning over the side, by the
7759	perpendicular ladder of nailed cleets there, and swinging towards him
7760	a pair of tastefully-ornamented man-ropes; for at first they did not
7761	seem to bethink them that a one-legged man must be too much of a
7762	cripple to use their sea bannisters.  But this awkwardness only
7763	lasted a minute, because the strange captain, observing at a glance
7764	"how affairs stood, cried out, I see, I see!--avast heaving there!
Jump, boys, and swing over the cutting-tackle."
7765	
7766	As good luck would have it, they had had a whale alongside a day or
7767	two previous, and the great tackles were still aloft, and the massive
7768	curved blubber-hook, now clean and dry, was still attached to the
7769	end.  This was quickly lowered to Ahab, who at once comprehending it
7770	all, slid his solitary thigh into the curve of the hook (it was like
7771	sitting in the fluke of an anchor, or the crotch of an apple tree),
7772	and then giving the word, held himself fast, and at the same time
7773	also helped to hoist his own weight, by pulling hand-over-hand upon
7774	one of the running parts of the tackle.  Soon he was carefully swung
7775	inside the high bulwarks, and gently landed upon the capstan head.
7776	With his ivory arm frankly thrust forth in welcome, the other captain
7777	advanced, and Ahab, putting out his ivory leg, and crossing the ivory
7778	"arm (like two sword-fish blades) cried out in his walrus way, Aye,
aye, hearty! let us shake bones together!--an arm and a leg!--an arm
that never can shrink, d'ye see; and a leg that never can run.  Where
did'st thou see the White Whale?--how long ago?"
7779	
7780	The White Whale, said the Englishman, pointing his ivory arm
7781	towards the East, and taking a rueful sight along it, as if it had
7782	been a telescope; there I saw him, on the Line, last season.
7783	
7784	And he took that arm off, did he? asked Ahab, now sliding down from
7785	the capstan, and resting on the Englishman's shoulder, as he did so.
7786	
7787	Aye, he was the cause of it, at least; and that leg, too?
7788	
7789	Spin me the yarn, said Ahab; how was it?
7790	
7791	It was the first time in my life that I ever cruised on the Line,
7792	"began the Englishman.  I was ignorant of the White Whale at that
time.  Well, one day we lowered for a pod of four or five whales, and
my boat fastened to one of them; a regular circus horse he was, too,
that went milling and milling round so, that my boat's crew could
only trim dish, by sitting all their sterns on the outer gunwale.
Presently up breaches from the bottom of the sea a bouncing great
whale, with a milky-white head and hump, all crows' feet and
wrinkles."
7793	
7794	It was he, it was he! cried Ahab, suddenly letting out his
7795	suspended breath.
7796	
7797	And harpoons sticking in near his starboard fin.
7798	
7799	"Aye, aye--they were mine--MY irons, cried Ahab, exultingly--but
on!"
7800	
7801	Give me a chance, then, said the Englishman, good-humoredly.
7802	"Well, this old great-grandfather, with the white head and hump, runs
all afoam into the pod, and goes to snapping furiously at my
fast-line!

Aye, I see!--wanted to part it; free the fast-fish--an old trick--I"
7803	"know him.

How it was exactly, continued the one-armed commander, I do not"
7804	know; but in biting the line, it got foul of his teeth, caught there
7805	somehow; but we didn't know it then; so that when we afterwards
7806	pulled on the line, bounce we came plump on to his hump! instead of
7807	the other whale's; that went off to windward, all fluking.  Seeing
7808	how matters stood, and what a noble great whale it was--the noblest
7809	and biggest I ever saw, sir, in my life--I resolved to capture him,
7810	spite of the boiling rage he seemed to be in.  And thinking the
7811	hap-hazard line would get loose, or the tooth it was tangled to
7812	might draw (for I have a devil of a boat's crew for a pull on a
7813	whale-line); seeing all this, I say, I jumped into my first mate's
7814	boat--Mr. Mounttop's here (by the way, Captain--Mounttop;
7815	Mounttop--the captain);--as I was saying, I jumped into Mounttop's
7816	boat, which, d'ye see, was gunwale and gunwale with mine, then; and
7817	snatching the first harpoon, let this old great-grandfather have it.
7818	But, Lord, look you, sir--hearts and souls alive, man--the next
7819	instant, in a jiff, I was blind as a bat--both eyes out--all befogged
7820	and bedeadened with black foam--the whale's tail looming straight up
7821	out of it, perpendicular in the air, like a marble steeple.  No use
7822	sterning all, then; but as I was groping at midday, with a blinding
7823	sun, all crown-jewels; as I was groping, I say, after the second
7824	iron, to toss it overboard--down comes the tail like a Lima tower,
7825	cutting my boat in two, leaving each half in splinters; and, flukes
7826	first, the white hump backed through the wreck, as though it was all
7827	chips.  We all struck out.  To escape his terrible flailings, I
7828	seized hold of my harpoon-pole sticking in him, and for a moment
7829	clung to that like a sucking fish.  But a combing sea dashed me off,
7830	and at the same instant, the fish, taking one good dart forwards,
7831	went down like a flash; and the barb of that cursed second iron
7832	"towing along near me caught me here (clapping his hand just below
his shoulder); yes, caught me just here, I say, and bore me down to"
7833	Hell's flames, I was thinking; when, when, all of a sudden, thank the
7834	good God, the barb ript its way along the flesh--clear along the
7835	whole length of my arm--came out nigh my wrist, and up I
7836	floated;--and that gentleman there will tell you the rest (by the
7837	way, captain--Dr. Bunger, ship's surgeon: Bunger, my lad,--the
7838	"captain).  Now, Bunger boy, spin your part of the yarn.

The professional gentleman thus familiarly pointed out, had been all
the time standing near them, with nothing specific visible, to denote
his gentlemanly rank on board.  His face was an exceedingly round but
sober one; he was dressed in a faded blue woollen frock or shirt, and
patched trowsers; and had thus far been dividing his attention
between a marlingspike he held in one hand, and a pill-box held in
the other, occasionally casting a critical glance at the ivory limbs
of the two crippled captains.  But, at his superior's introduction of
him to Ahab, he politely bowed, and straightway went on to do his
captain's bidding.

It was a shocking bad wound, began the whale-surgeon; and, taking"
7839	"my advice, Captain Boomer here, stood our old Sammy--

Samuel Enderby is the name of my ship, interrupted the one-armed
captain, addressing Ahab; go on, boy.

Stood our old Sammy off to the northward, to get out of the blazing"
7840	hot weather there on the Line.  But it was no use--I did all I could;
7841	sat up with him nights; was very severe with him in the matter of
7842	"diet--

Oh, very severe! chimed in the patient himself; then suddenly
altering his voice, Drinking hot rum toddies with me every night,"
7843	till he couldn't see to put on the bandages; and sending me to bed,
7844	half seas over, about three o'clock in the morning.  Oh, ye stars! he
7845	sat up with me indeed, and was very severe in my diet.  Oh! a great
7846	watcher, and very dietetically severe, is Dr. Bunger. (Bunger, you
7847	dog, laugh out! why don't ye?  You know you're a precious jolly
7848	rascal.) But, heave ahead, boy, I'd rather be killed by you than kept
7849	"alive by any other man.

My captain, you must have ere this perceived, respected sir--said
the imperturbable godly-looking Bunger, slightly bowing to Ahab--is"
7850	apt to be facetious at times; he spins us many clever things of that
7851	sort.  But I may as well say--en passant, as the French remark--that
7852	I myself--that is to say, Jack Bunger, late of the reverend
7853	"clergy--am a strict total abstinence man; I never drink--

Water! cried the captain; he never drinks it; it's a sort of fits"
7854	to him; fresh water throws him into the hydrophobia; but go on--go on
7855	"with the arm story.

Yes, I may as well, said the surgeon, coolly.  I was about"
7856	observing, sir, before Captain Boomer's facetious interruption, that
7857	spite of my best and severest endeavors, the wound kept getting worse
7858	and worse; the truth was, sir, it was as ugly gaping wound as surgeon
7859	ever saw; more than two feet and several inches long.  I measured it
7860	with the lead line.  In short, it grew black; I knew what was
7861	threatened, and off it came.  But I had no hand in shipping that
7862	"ivory arm there; that thing is against all rule--pointing at it with
the marlingspike--that is the captain's work, not mine; he ordered"
7863	the carpenter to make it; he had that club-hammer there put to the
7864	end, to knock some one's brains out with, I suppose, as he tried mine
7865	once.  He flies into diabolical passions sometimes.  Do ye see this
7866	"dent, sir--removing his hat, and brushing aside his hair, and
exposing a bowl-like cavity in his skull, but which bore not the
slightest scarry trace, or any token of ever having been a
wound--Well, the captain there will tell you how that came here;"
7867	"he knows.

No, I don't, said the captain, but his mother did; he was born"
7868	with it.  Oh, you solemn rogue, you--you Bunger! was there ever such
7869	another Bunger in the watery world?  Bunger, when you die, you ought
7870	to die in pickle, you dog; you should be preserved to future ages,
7871	"you rascal.

What became of the White Whale? now cried Ahab, who thus far had
been impatiently listening to this by-play between the two
Englishmen.

Oh! cried the one-armed captain, oh, yes!  Well; after he sounded,"
7872	we didn't see him again for some time; in fact, as I before hinted, I
7873	didn't then know what whale it was that had served me such a trick,
7874	till some time afterwards, when coming back to the Line, we heard
7875	"about Moby Dick--as some call him--and then I knew it was he.

Did'st thou cross his wake again?

Twice.

But could not fasten?

Didn't want to try to: ain't one limb enough?  What should I do"
7876	without this other arm?  And I'm thinking Moby Dick doesn't bite so
7877	"much as he swallows.

Well, then, interrupted Bunger, give him your left arm for bait to"
7878	"get the right.  Do you know, gentlemen--very gravely and
mathematically bowing to each Captain in succession--Do you know,"
7879	gentlemen, that the digestive organs of the whale are so inscrutably
7880	constructed by Divine Providence, that it is quite impossible for him
7881	to completely digest even a man's arm?  And he knows it too.  So that
7882	what you take for the White Whale's malice is only his awkwardness.
7883	For he never means to swallow a single limb; he only thinks to
7884	terrify by feints.  But sometimes he is like the old juggling fellow,
7885	formerly a patient of mine in Ceylon, that making believe swallow
7886	jack-knives, once upon a time let one drop into him in good earnest,
7887	and there it stayed for a twelvemonth or more; when I gave him an
7888	emetic, and he heaved it up in small tacks, d'ye see.  No possible
7889	way for him to digest that jack-knife, and fully incorporate it into
7890	his general bodily system.  Yes, Captain Boomer, if you are quick
7891	enough about it, and have a mind to pawn one arm for the sake of the
7892	privilege of giving decent burial to the other, why in that case
7893	the arm is yours; only let the whale have another chance at you
7894	"shortly, that's all.

No, thank ye, Bunger, said the English Captain, he's welcome to"
7895	the arm he has, since I can't help it, and didn't know him then; but
7896	not to another one.  No more White Whales for me; I've lowered for
7897	him once, and that has satisfied me.  There would be great glory in
7898	killing him, I know that; and there is a ship-load of precious sperm
7899	in him, but, hark ye, he's best let alone; don't you think so,
7900	"Captain?--glancing at the ivory leg.

He is.  But he will still be hunted, for all that.  What is best let"
7901	alone, that accursed thing is not always what least allures.  He's
7902	all a magnet!  How long since thou saw'st him last?  Which way
7903	"heading?

Bless my soul, and curse the foul fiend's, cried Bunger, stoopingly
walking round Ahab, and like a dog, strangely snuffing; this man's"
7904	blood--bring the thermometer!--it's at the boiling point!--his pulse
7905	"makes these planks beat!--sir!--taking a lancet from his pocket, and
drawing near to Ahab's arm.

Avast! roared Ahab, dashing him against the bulwarks--Man the"
7906	"boat!  Which way heading?

Good God! cried the English Captain, to whom the question was put.
What's the matter?  He was heading east, I think.--Is your Captain"
7907	"crazy? whispering Fedallah.

But Fedallah, putting a finger on his lip, slid over the bulwarks to
take the boat's steering oar, and Ahab, swinging the cutting-tackle
towards him, commanded the ship's sailors to stand by to lower.

In a moment he was standing in the boat's stern, and the Manilla men
were springing to their oars.  In vain the English Captain hailed
him.  With back to the stranger ship, and face set like a flint to
his own, Ahab stood upright till alongside of the Pequod.



CHAPTER 101

The Decanter.


Ere the English ship fades from sight, be it set down here, that she
hailed from London, and was named after the late Samuel Enderby,
merchant of that city, the original of the famous whaling house of
Enderby & Sons; a house which in my poor whaleman's opinion, comes
not far behind the united royal houses of the Tudors and Bourbons, in
point of real historical interest.  How long, prior to the year of
our Lord 1775, this great whaling house was in existence, my numerous
fish-documents do not make plain; but in that year (1775) it fitted
out the first English ships that ever regularly hunted the Sperm
Whale; though for some score of years previous (ever since 1726) our
valiant Coffins and Maceys of Nantucket and the Vineyard had in large
fleets pursued that Leviathan, but only in the North and South
Atlantic: not elsewhere.  Be it distinctly recorded here, that the
Nantucketers were the first among mankind to harpoon with civilized
steel the great Sperm Whale; and that for half a century they were
the only people of the whole globe who so harpooned him.

In 1778, a fine ship, the Amelia, fitted out for the express purpose,
and at the sole charge of the vigorous Enderbys, boldly rounded Cape
Horn, and was the first among the nations to lower a whale-boat of
any sort in the great South Sea.  The voyage was a skilful and lucky
one; and returning to her berth with her hold full of the precious
sperm, the Amelia's example was soon followed by other ships, English
and American, and thus the vast Sperm Whale grounds of the Pacific
were thrown open.  But not content with this good deed, the
indefatigable house again bestirred itself: Samuel and all his
Sons--how many, their mother only knows--and under their immediate
auspices, and partly, I think, at their expense, the British
government was induced to send the sloop-of-war Rattler on a whaling
voyage of discovery into the South Sea.  Commanded by a naval
Post-Captain, the Rattler made a rattling voyage of it, and did some
service; how much does not appear.  But this is not all.  In 1819,
the same house fitted out a discovery whale ship of their own, to go
on a tasting cruise to the remote waters of Japan.  That ship--well
called the Syren--made a noble experimental cruise; and it was thus
that the great Japanese Whaling Ground first became generally known.
The Syren in this famous voyage was commanded by a Captain Coffin, a
Nantucketer.

All honour to the Enderbies, therefore, whose house, I think, exists
to the present day; though doubtless the original Samuel must long
ago have slipped his cable for the great South Sea of the other
world.

The ship named after him was worthy of the honour, being a very fast
sailer and a noble craft every way.  I boarded her once at midnight
somewhere off the Patagonian coast, and drank good flip down in the
forecastle.  It was a fine gam we had, and they were all
trumps--every soul on board.  A short life to them, and a jolly
death.  And that fine gam I had--long, very long after old Ahab
touched her planks with his ivory heel--it minds me of the noble,
solid, Saxon hospitality of that ship; and may my parson forget me,
and the devil remember me, if I ever lose sight of it.  Flip?  Did I
say we had flip?  Yes, and we flipped it at the rate of ten gallons
the hour; and when the squall came (for it's squally off there by
Patagonia), and all hands--visitors and all--were called to reef
topsails, we were so top-heavy that we had to swing each other aloft
in bowlines; and we ignorantly furled the skirts of our jackets into
the sails, so that we hung there, reefed fast in the howling gale, a
warning example to all drunken tars.  However, the masts did not go
overboard; and by and by we scrambled down, so sober, that we had to
pass the flip again, though the savage salt spray bursting down the
forecastle scuttle, rather too much diluted and pickled it to my
taste.

The beef was fine--tough, but with body in it.  They said it was
bull-beef; others, that it was dromedary beef; but I do not know, for
certain, how that was.  They had dumplings too; small, but
substantial, symmetrically globular, and indestructible dumplings.  I
fancied that you could feel them, and roll them about in you after
they were swallowed.  If you stooped over too far forward, you risked
their pitching out of you like billiard-balls.  The bread--but that
couldn't be helped; besides, it was an anti-scorbutic; in short, the
bread contained the only fresh fare they had.  But the forecastle was
not very light, and it was very easy to step over into a dark corner
when you ate it.  But all in all, taking her from truck to helm,
considering the dimensions of the cook's boilers, including his own
live parchment boilers; fore and aft, I say, the Samuel Enderby was a
jolly ship; of good fare and plenty; fine flip and strong; crack
fellows all, and capital from boot heels to hat-band.

But why was it, think ye, that the Samuel Enderby, and some other
English whalers I know of--not all though--were such famous,
hospitable ships; that passed round the beef, and the bread, and the
can, and the joke; and were not soon weary of eating, and drinking,
and laughing?  I will tell you.  The abounding good cheer of these
English whalers is matter for historical research.  Nor have I been
at all sparing of historical whale research, when it has seemed
needed.

The English were preceded in the whale fishery by the Hollanders,
Zealanders, and Danes; from whom they derived many terms still extant
in the fishery; and what is yet more, their fat old fashions,
touching plenty to eat and drink.  For, as a general thing, the
English merchant-ship scrimps her crew; but not so the English
whaler.  Hence, in the English, this thing of whaling good cheer is
not normal and natural, but incidental and particular; and,
therefore, must have some special origin, which is here pointed out,
and will be still further elucidated.

During my researches in the Leviathanic histories, I stumbled upon an
ancient Dutch volume, which, by the musty whaling smell of it, I knew
must be about whalers.  The title was, Dan Coopman, wherefore I
concluded that this must be the invaluable memoirs of some Amsterdam
cooper in the fishery, as every whale ship must carry its cooper.  I
was reinforced in this opinion by seeing that it was the production
of one Fitz Swackhammer.  But my friend Dr. Snodhead, a very
learned man, professor of Low Dutch and High German in the college of
Santa Claus and St. Pott's, to whom I handed the work for
translation, giving him a box of sperm candles for his trouble--this
same Dr. Snodhead, so soon as he spied the book, assured me that Dan"
7908	"Coopman did not mean The Cooper, but The Merchant.  In short,
this ancient and learned Low Dutch book treated of the commerce of
Holland; and, among other subjects, contained a very interesting
account of its whale fishery.  And in this chapter it was, headed,
Smeer, or Fat, that I found a long detailed list of the outfits
for the larders and cellars of 180 sail of Dutch whalemen; from which
list, as translated by Dr. Snodhead, I transcribe the following:

400,000 lbs. of beef.
60,000 lbs. Friesland pork.
150,000 lbs. of stock fish.
550,000 lbs. of biscuit.
72,000 lbs. of soft bread.
2,800 firkins of butter.
20,000 lbs. Texel & Leyden cheese.
144,000 lbs. cheese (probably an inferior article).
550 ankers of Geneva.
10,800 barrels of beer.

Most statistical tables are parchingly dry in the reading; not so in
the present case, however, where the reader is flooded with whole
pipes, barrels, quarts, and gills of good gin and good cheer.

At the time, I devoted three days to the studious digesting of all
this beer, beef, and bread, during which many profound thoughts were
incidentally suggested to me, capable of a transcendental and
Platonic application; and, furthermore, I compiled supplementary
tables of my own, touching the probable quantity of stock-fish, etc.,
consumed by every Low Dutch harpooneer in that ancient Greenland and
Spitzbergen whale fishery.  In the first place, the amount of butter,
and Texel and Leyden cheese consumed, seems amazing.  I impute it,
though, to their naturally unctuous natures, being rendered still
more unctuous by the nature of their vocation, and especially by
their pursuing their game in those frigid Polar Seas, on the very
coasts of that Esquimaux country where the convivial natives pledge
each other in bumpers of train oil.

The quantity of beer, too, is very large, 10,800 barrels.  Now,
as those polar fisheries could only be prosecuted in the short summer
of that climate, so that the whole cruise of one of these Dutch
whalemen, including the short voyage to and from the Spitzbergen sea,
did not much exceed three months, say, and reckoning 30 men to each
of their fleet of 180 sail, we have 5,400 Low Dutch seamen in all;
therefore, I say, we have precisely two barrels of beer per man, for
a twelve weeks' allowance, exclusive of his fair proportion of that
550 ankers of gin.  Now, whether these gin and beer harpooneers, so
fuddled as one might fancy them to have been, were the right sort of
men to stand up in a boat's head, and take good aim at flying whales;
this would seem somewhat improbable.  Yet they did aim at them, and
hit them too.  But this was very far North, be it remembered, where
beer agrees well with the constitution; upon the Equator, in our
southern fishery, beer would be apt to make the harpooneer sleepy at
the mast-head and boozy in his boat; and grievous loss might ensue to
Nantucket and New Bedford.

But no more; enough has been said to show that the old Dutch whalers
of two or three centuries ago were high livers; and that the English
whalers have not neglected so excellent an example.  For, say they,
when cruising in an empty ship, if you can get nothing better out of
the world, get a good dinner out of it, at least.  And this empties
the decanter.



CHAPTER 102

A Bower in the Arsacides.


Hitherto, in descriptively treating of the Sperm Whale, I have
chiefly dwelt upon the marvels of his outer aspect; or separately and
in detail upon some few interior structural features.  But to a large
and thorough sweeping comprehension of him, it behooves me now to
unbutton him still further, and untagging the points of his hose,
unbuckling his garters, and casting loose the hooks and the eyes of
the joints of his innermost bones, set him before you in his
ultimatum; that is to say, in his unconditional skeleton.

But how now, Ishmael?  How is it, that you, a mere oarsman in the
fishery, pretend to know aught about the subterranean parts of the
whale?  Did erudite Stubb, mounted upon your capstan, deliver
lectures on the anatomy of the Cetacea; and by help of the windlass,
hold up a specimen rib for exhibition?  Explain thyself, Ishmael.
Can you land a full-grown whale on your deck for examination, as a
cook dishes a roast-pig?  Surely not.  A veritable witness have you
hitherto been, Ishmael; but have a care how you seize the privilege
of Jonah alone; the privilege of discoursing upon the joists and
beams; the rafters, ridge-pole, sleepers, and under-pinnings, making
up the frame-work of leviathan; and belike of the tallow-vats,
dairy-rooms, butteries, and cheeseries in his bowels.

I confess, that since Jonah, few whalemen have penetrated very far
beneath the skin of the adult whale; nevertheless, I have been
blessed with an opportunity to dissect him in miniature.  In a ship I
belonged to, a small cub Sperm Whale was once bodily hoisted to the
deck for his poke or bag, to make sheaths for the barbs of the
harpoons, and for the heads of the lances.  Think you I let that
chance go, without using my boat-hatchet and jack-knife, and breaking
the seal and reading all the contents of that young cub?

And as for my exact knowledge of the bones of the leviathan in their
gigantic, full grown development, for that rare knowledge I am
indebted to my late royal friend Tranquo, king of Tranque, one of
the Arsacides.  For being at Tranque, years ago, when attached to the
trading-ship Dey of Algiers, I was invited to spend part of the
Arsacidean holidays with the lord of Tranque, at his retired palm
villa at Pupella; a sea-side glen not very far distant from what our
sailors called Bamboo-Town, his capital.

Among many other fine qualities, my royal friend Tranquo, being
gifted with a devout love for all matters of barbaric vertu, had
brought together in Pupella whatever rare things the more ingenious
of his people could invent; chiefly carved woods of wonderful
devices, chiselled shells, inlaid spears, costly paddles, aromatic
canoes; and all these distributed among whatever natural wonders, the
wonder-freighted, tribute-rendering waves had cast upon his shores.

Chief among these latter was a great Sperm Whale, which, after an
unusually long raging gale, had been found dead and stranded, with
his head against a cocoa-nut tree, whose plumage-like, tufted
droopings seemed his verdant jet.  When the vast body had at last
been stripped of its fathom-deep enfoldings, and the bones become
dust dry in the sun, then the skeleton was carefully transported up
the Pupella glen, where a grand temple of lordly palms now sheltered
it.

The ribs were hung with trophies; the vertebrae were carved with
Arsacidean annals, in strange hieroglyphics; in the skull, the
priests kept up an unextinguished aromatic flame, so that the mystic
head again sent forth its vapoury spout; while, suspended from a
bough, the terrific lower jaw vibrated over all the devotees, like
the hair-hung sword that so affrighted Damocles.

It was a wondrous sight.  The wood was green as mosses of the Icy
Glen; the trees stood high and haughty, feeling their living sap; the
industrious earth beneath was as a weaver's loom, with a gorgeous
carpet on it, whereof the ground-vine tendrils formed the warp and
woof, and the living flowers the figures.  All the trees, with all
their laden branches; all the shrubs, and ferns, and grasses; the
message-carrying air; all these unceasingly were active.  Through the
lacings of the leaves, the great sun seemed a flying shuttle weaving
the unwearied verdure.  Oh, busy weaver! unseen weaver!--pause!--one
word!--whither flows the fabric? what palace may it deck? wherefore
all these ceaseless toilings?  Speak, weaver!--stay thy hand!--but
one single word with thee!  Nay--the shuttle flies--the figures float
from forth the loom; the freshet-rushing carpet for ever slides
away.  The weaver-god, he weaves; and by that weaving is he deafened,
that he hears no mortal voice; and by that humming, we, too, who look
on the loom are deafened; and only when we escape it shall we hear
the thousand voices that speak through it.  For even so it is in all
material factories.  The spoken words that are inaudible among the
flying spindles; those same words are plainly heard without the
walls, bursting from the opened casements.  Thereby have villainies
been detected.  Ah, mortal! then, be heedful; for so, in all this din
of the great world's loom, thy subtlest thinkings may be overheard
afar.

Now, amid the green, life-restless loom of that Arsacidean wood, the
great, white, worshipped skeleton lay lounging--a gigantic idler!
Yet, as the ever-woven verdant warp and woof intermixed and hummed
around him, the mighty idler seemed the cunning weaver; himself all
woven over with the vines; every month assuming greener, fresher
verdure; but himself a skeleton.  Life folded Death; Death trellised
Life; the grim god wived with youthful Life, and begat him
curly-headed glories.

Now, when with royal Tranquo I visited this wondrous whale, and saw
the skull an altar, and the artificial smoke ascending from where the
real jet had issued, I marvelled that the king should regard a chapel
as an object of vertu.  He laughed.  But more I marvelled that the
priests should swear that smoky jet of his was genuine.  To and fro I
paced before this skeleton--brushed the vines aside--broke through
the ribs--and with a ball of Arsacidean twine, wandered, eddied long
amid its many winding, shaded colonnades and arbours.  But soon my
line was out; and following it back, I emerged from the opening where I
entered.  I saw no living thing within; naught was there but bones.

Cutting me a green measuring-rod, I once more dived within the
skeleton.  From their arrow-slit in the skull, the priests perceived
me taking the altitude of the final rib, How now! they shouted;
Dar'st thou measure this our god!  That's for us.  Aye,"
7909	"priests--well, how long do ye make him, then?  But hereupon a fierce
contest rose among them, concerning feet and inches; they cracked
each other's sconces with their yard-sticks--the great skull
echoed--and seizing that lucky chance, I quickly concluded my own
admeasurements.

These admeasurements I now propose to set before you.  But first, be
it recorded, that, in this matter, I am not free to utter any fancied
measurement I please.  Because there are skeleton authorities you
can refer to, to test my accuracy.  There is a Leviathanic Museum,
they tell me, in Hull, England, one of the whaling ports of that
country, where they have some fine specimens of fin-backs and other
whales.  Likewise, I have heard that in the museum of Manchester, in
New Hampshire, they have what the proprietors call the only perfect"
7910	"specimen of a Greenland or River Whale in the United States.
Moreover, at a place in Yorkshire, England, Burton Constable by name,
a certain Sir Clifford Constable has in his possession the skeleton
of a Sperm Whale, but of moderate size, by no means of the full-grown
magnitude of my friend King Tranquo's.

In both cases, the stranded whales to which these two skeletons
belonged, were originally claimed by their proprietors upon similar
grounds.  King Tranquo seizing his because he wanted it; and Sir
Clifford, because he was lord of the seignories of those parts.  Sir
Clifford's whale has been articulated throughout; so that, like a
great chest of drawers, you can open and shut him, in all his bony
cavities--spread out his ribs like a gigantic fan--and swing all day
upon his lower jaw.  Locks are to be put upon some of his trap-doors
and shutters; and a footman will show round future visitors with a
bunch of keys at his side.  Sir Clifford thinks of charging twopence
for a peep at the whispering gallery in the spinal column; threepence
to hear the echo in the hollow of his cerebellum; and sixpence for
the unrivalled view from his forehead.

The skeleton dimensions I shall now proceed to set down are copied
verbatim from my right arm, where I had them tattooed; as in my wild
wanderings at that period, there was no other secure way of
preserving such valuable statistics.  But as I was crowded for space,
and wished the other parts of my body to remain a blank page for a
poem I was then composing--at least, what untattooed parts might
remain--I did not trouble myself with the odd inches; nor, indeed,
should inches at all enter into a congenial admeasurement of the
whale.



CHAPTER 103

Measurement of The Whale's Skeleton.


In the first place, I wish to lay before you a particular, plain
statement, touching the living bulk of this leviathan, whose skeleton
we are briefly to exhibit.  Such a statement may prove useful here.

According to a careful calculation I have made, and which I partly
base upon Captain Scoresby's estimate, of seventy tons for the
largest sized Greenland whale of sixty feet in length; according to
my careful calculation, I say, a Sperm Whale of the largest
magnitude, between eighty-five and ninety feet in length, and
something less than forty feet in its fullest circumference, such a
whale will weigh at least ninety tons; so that, reckoning thirteen
men to a ton, he would considerably outweigh the combined population
of a whole village of one thousand one hundred inhabitants.

Think you not then that brains, like yoked cattle, should be put to
this leviathan, to make him at all budge to any landsman's
imagination?

Having already in various ways put before you his skull, spout-hole,
jaw, teeth, tail, forehead, fins, and divers other parts, I shall now
simply point out what is most interesting in the general bulk of his
unobstructed bones.  But as the colossal skull embraces so very large
a proportion of the entire extent of the skeleton; as it is by far
the most complicated part; and as nothing is to be repeated
concerning it in this chapter, you must not fail to carry it in your
mind, or under your arm, as we proceed, otherwise you will not gain a
complete notion of the general structure we are about to view.

In length, the Sperm Whale's skeleton at Tranque measured seventy-two
Feet; so that when fully invested and extended in life, he must have
been ninety feet long; for in the whale, the skeleton loses about one
fifth in length compared with the living body.  Of this seventy-two
feet, his skull and jaw comprised some twenty feet, leaving some
fifty feet of plain back-bone.  Attached to this back-bone, for
something less than a third of its length, was the mighty circular
basket of ribs which once enclosed his vitals.

To me this vast ivory-ribbed chest, with the long, unrelieved spine,
extending far away from it in a straight line, not a little resembled
the hull of a great ship new-laid upon the stocks, when only some
twenty of her naked bow-ribs are inserted, and the keel is otherwise,
for the time, but a long, disconnected timber.

The ribs were ten on a side.  The first, to begin from the neck, was
nearly six feet long; the second, third, and fourth were each
successively longer, till you came to the climax of the fifth, or one
of the middle ribs, which measured eight feet and some inches.  From
that part, the remaining ribs diminished, till the tenth and last
only spanned five feet and some inches.  In general thickness, they
all bore a seemly correspondence to their length.  The middle ribs
were the most arched.  In some of the Arsacides they are used for
beams whereon to lay footpath bridges over small streams.

In considering these ribs, I could not but be struck anew with the
circumstance, so variously repeated in this book, that the skeleton
of the whale is by no means the mould of his invested form.  The
largest of the Tranque ribs, one of the middle ones, occupied that
part of the fish which, in life, is greatest in depth.  Now, the
greatest depth of the invested body of this particular whale must
have been at least sixteen feet; whereas, the corresponding rib
measured but little more than eight feet.  So that this rib only
conveyed half of the true notion of the living magnitude of that
part.  Besides, for some way, where I now saw but a naked spine, all
that had been once wrapped round with tons of added bulk in flesh,
muscle, blood, and bowels.  Still more, for the ample fins, I here
saw but a few disordered joints; and in place of the weighty and
majestic, but boneless flukes, an utter blank!

How vain and foolish, then, thought I, for timid untravelled man to
try to comprehend aright this wondrous whale, by merely poring over
his dead attenuated skeleton, stretched in this peaceful wood.  No.
Only in the heart of quickest perils; only when within the eddyings
of his angry flukes; only on the profound unbounded sea, can the
fully invested whale be truly and livingly found out.

But the spine.  For that, the best way we can consider it is, with a
crane, to pile its bones high up on end.  No speedy enterprise.  But
now it's done, it looks much like Pompey's Pillar.

There are forty and odd vertebrae in all, which in the skeleton are
not locked together.  They mostly lie like the great knobbed blocks
on a Gothic spire, forming solid courses of heavy masonry.  The
largest, a middle one, is in width something less than three feet,
and in depth more than four.  The smallest, where the spine tapers
away into the tail, is only two inches in width, and looks something
like a white billiard-ball.  I was told that there were still smaller
ones, but they had been lost by some little cannibal urchins, the
priest's children, who had stolen them to play marbles with.  Thus we
see how that the spine of even the hugest of living things tapers off
at last into simple child's play.



CHAPTER 104

The Fossil Whale.


From his mighty bulk the whale affords a most congenial theme whereon
to enlarge, amplify, and generally expatiate.  Would you, you could
not compress him.  By good rights he should only be treated of in
imperial folio.  Not to tell over again his furlongs from spiracle to
tail, and the yards he measures about the waist; only think of the
gigantic involutions of his intestines, where they lie in him like
great cables and hawsers coiled away in the subterranean orlop-deck
of a line-of-battle-ship.

Since I have undertaken to manhandle this Leviathan, it behooves me
to approve myself omnisciently exhaustive in the enterprise; not
overlooking the minutest seminal germs of his blood, and spinning him
out to the uttermost coil of his bowels.  Having already described
him in most of his present habitatory and anatomical peculiarities,
it now remains to magnify him in an archaeological, fossiliferous,
and antediluvian point of view.  Applied to any other creature than
the Leviathan--to an ant or a flea--such portly terms might justly be
deemed unwarrantably grandiloquent.  But when Leviathan is the text,
the case is altered.  Fain am I to stagger to this emprise under
the weightiest words of the dictionary.  And here be it said, that
whenever it has been convenient to consult one in the course of these
dissertations, I have invariably used a huge quarto edition of
Johnson, expressly purchased for that purpose; because that famous
lexicographer's uncommon personal bulk more fitted him to compile a
lexicon to be used by a whale author like me.

One often hears of writers that rise and swell with their subject,
though it may seem but an ordinary one.  How, then, with me, writing
of this Leviathan?  Unconsciously my chirography expands into placard
capitals.  Give me a condor's quill!  Give me Vesuvius' crater for an
inkstand!  Friends, hold my arms!  For in the mere act of penning my
thoughts of this Leviathan, they weary me, and make me faint with
their outreaching comprehensiveness of sweep, as if to include the
whole circle of the sciences, and all the generations of whales, and
men, and mastodons, past, present, and to come, with all the
revolving panoramas of empire on earth, and throughout the whole
universe, not excluding its suburbs.  Such, and so magnifying, is the
virtue of a large and liberal theme!  We expand to its bulk.  To
produce a mighty book, you must choose a mighty theme.  No great and
enduring volume can ever be written on the flea, though many there be
who have tried it.

Ere entering upon the subject of Fossil Whales, I present my
credentials as a geologist, by stating that in my miscellaneous time
I have been a stone-mason, and also a great digger of ditches,
canals and wells, wine-vaults, cellars, and cisterns of all sorts.
Likewise, by way of preliminary, I desire to remind the reader, that
while in the earlier geological strata there are found the fossils of
monsters now almost completely extinct; the subsequent relics
discovered in what are called the Tertiary formations seem the
connecting, or at any rate intercepted links, between the
antichronical creatures, and those whose remote posterity are said to
have entered the Ark; all the Fossil Whales hitherto discovered
belong to the Tertiary period, which is the last preceding the
superficial formations.  And though none of them precisely answer to
any known species of the present time, they are yet sufficiently akin
to them in general respects, to justify their taking rank as
Cetacean fossils.

Detached broken fossils of pre-adamite whales, fragments of their
bones and skeletons, have within thirty years past, at various
intervals, been found at the base of the Alps, in Lombardy, in
France, in England, in Scotland, and in the States of Louisiana,
Mississippi, and Alabama.  Among the more curious of such remains is
part of a skull, which in the year 1779 was disinterred in the Rue
Dauphine in Paris, a short street opening almost directly upon the
palace of the Tuileries; and bones disinterred in excavating the
great docks of Antwerp, in Napoleon's time.  Cuvier pronounced these
fragments to have belonged to some utterly unknown Leviathanic
species.

But by far the most wonderful of all Cetacean relics was the almost
complete vast skeleton of an extinct monster, found in the year 1842,
on the plantation of Judge Creagh, in Alabama.  The awe-stricken
credulous slaves in the vicinity took it for the bones of one of the
fallen angels.  The Alabama doctors declared it a huge reptile, and
bestowed upon it the name of Basilosaurus.  But some specimen bones
of it being taken across the sea to Owen, the English Anatomist, it
turned out that this alleged reptile was a whale, though of a
departed species.  A significant illustration of the fact, again and
again repeated in this book, that the skeleton of the whale furnishes
but little clue to the shape of his fully invested body.  So Owen
rechristened the monster Zeuglodon; and in his paper read before the
London Geological Society, pronounced it, in substance, one of the
most extraordinary creatures which the mutations of the globe have
blotted out of existence.

When I stand among these mighty Leviathan skeletons, skulls, tusks,
jaws, ribs, and vertebrae, all characterized by partial resemblances
to the existing breeds of sea-monsters; but at the same time bearing
on the other hand similar affinities to the annihilated antichronical
Leviathans, their incalculable seniors; I am, by a flood, borne back
to that wondrous period, ere time itself can be said to have begun;
for time began with man.  Here Saturn's grey chaos rolls over me, and
I obtain dim, shuddering glimpses into those Polar eternities; when
wedged bastions of ice pressed hard upon what are now the Tropics;
and in all the 25,000 miles of this world's circumference, not an
inhabitable hand's breadth of land was visible.  Then the whole world
was the whale's; and, king of creation, he left his wake along the
present lines of the Andes and the Himmalehs.  Who can show a
pedigree like Leviathan?  Ahab's harpoon had shed older blood than
the Pharaoh's.  Methuselah seems a school-boy.  I look round to shake
hands with Shem.  I am horror-struck at this antemosaic, unsourced
existence of the unspeakable terrors of the whale, which, having been
before all time, must needs exist after all humane ages are over.

But not alone has this Leviathan left his pre-adamite traces in the
stereotype plates of nature, and in limestone and marl bequeathed his
ancient bust; but upon Egyptian tablets, whose antiquity seems to
claim for them an almost fossiliferous character, we find the
unmistakable print of his fin.  In an apartment of the great temple
of Denderah, some fifty years ago, there was discovered upon the
granite ceiling a sculptured and painted planisphere, abounding in
centaurs, griffins, and dolphins, similar to the grotesque figures
on the celestial globe of the moderns.  Gliding among them, old
Leviathan swam as of yore; was there swimming in that planisphere,
centuries before Solomon was cradled.

Nor must there be omitted another strange attestation of the
antiquity of the whale, in his own osseous post-diluvian reality, as
set down by the venerable John Leo, the old Barbary traveller.

Not far from the Sea-side, they have a Temple, the Rafters and Beams"
7911	of which are made of Whale-Bones; for Whales of a monstrous size are
7912	oftentimes cast up dead upon that shore.  The Common People imagine,
7913	that by a secret Power bestowed by God upon the temple, no Whale can
7914	pass it without immediate death.  But the truth of the Matter is,
7915	that on either side of the Temple, there are Rocks that shoot two
7916	Miles into the Sea, and wound the Whales when they light upon 'em.
7917	They keep a Whale's Rib of an incredible length for a Miracle, which
7918	lying upon the Ground with its convex part uppermost, makes an Arch,
7919	the Head of which cannot be reached by a Man upon a Camel's Back.
7920	This Rib (says John Leo) is said to have layn there a hundred Years
7921	before I saw it.  Their Historians affirm, that a Prophet who
7922	prophesy'd of Mahomet, came from this Temple, and some do not stand
7923	to assert, that the Prophet Jonas was cast forth by the Whale at the
7924	"Base of the Temple.

In this Afric Temple of the Whale I leave you, reader, and if you be
a Nantucketer, and a whaleman, you will silently worship there.



CHAPTER 105

Does the Whale's Magnitude Diminish?--Will He Perish?


Inasmuch, then, as this Leviathan comes floundering down upon us from
the head-waters of the Eternities, it may be fitly inquired, whether,
in the long course of his generations, he has not degenerated from
the original bulk of his sires.

But upon investigation we find, that not only are the whales of the
present day superior in magnitude to those whose fossil remains are
found in the Tertiary system (embracing a distinct geological period
prior to man), but of the whales found in that Tertiary system, those
belonging to its latter formations exceed in size those of its
earlier ones.

Of all the pre-adamite whales yet exhumed, by far the largest is the
Alabama one mentioned in the last chapter, and that was less than
seventy feet in length in the skeleton.  Whereas, we have already
seen, that the tape-measure gives seventy-two feet for the skeleton
of a large sized modern whale.  And I have heard, on whalemen's
authority, that Sperm Whales have been captured near a hundred feet
long at the time of capture.

But may it not be, that while the whales of the present hour are an
advance in magnitude upon those of all previous geological periods;
may it not be, that since Adam's time they have degenerated?

Assuredly, we must conclude so, if we are to credit the accounts of
such gentlemen as Pliny, and the ancient naturalists generally.  For
Pliny tells us of Whales that embraced acres of living bulk, and
Aldrovandus of others which measured eight hundred feet in
length--Rope Walks and Thames Tunnels of Whales!  And even in the
days of Banks and Solander, Cooke's naturalists, we find a Danish
member of the Academy of Sciences setting down certain Iceland Whales
(reydan-siskur, or Wrinkled Bellies) at one hundred and twenty yards;
that is, three hundred and sixty feet.  And Lacepede, the French
naturalist, in his elaborate history of whales, in the very beginning
of his work (page 3), sets down the Right Whale at one hundred
metres, three hundred and twenty-eight feet.  And this work was
published so late as A.D. 1825.

But will any whaleman believe these stories?  No.  The whale of
to-day is as big as his ancestors in Pliny's time.  And if ever I go
where Pliny is, I, a whaleman (more than he was), will make bold to
tell him so.  Because I cannot understand how it is, that while the
Egyptian mummies that were buried thousands of years before even
Pliny was born, do not measure so much in their coffins as a modern
Kentuckian in his socks; and while the cattle and other animals
sculptured on the oldest Egyptian and Nineveh tablets, by the
relative proportions in which they are drawn, just as plainly prove
that the high-bred, stall-fed, prize cattle of Smithfield, not only
equal, but far exceed in magnitude the fattest of Pharaoh's fat kine;
in the face of all this, I will not admit that of all animals the
whale alone should have degenerated.

But still another inquiry remains; one often agitated by the more
recondite Nantucketers.  Whether owing to the almost omniscient
look-outs at the mast-heads of the whaleships, now penetrating even
through Behring's straits, and into the remotest secret drawers and
lockers of the world; and the thousand harpoons and lances darted
along all continental coasts; the moot point is, whether Leviathan
can long endure so wide a chase, and so remorseless a havoc; whether
he must not at last be exterminated from the waters, and the last
whale, like the last man, smoke his last pipe, and then himself
evaporate in the final puff.

Comparing the humped herds of whales with the humped herds of
buffalo, which, not forty years ago, overspread by tens of thousands
the prairies of Illinois and Missouri, and shook their iron manes and
scowled with their thunder-clotted brows upon the sites of populous
river-capitals, where now the polite broker sells you land at a
dollar an inch; in such a comparison an irresistible argument would
seem furnished, to show that the hunted whale cannot now escape
speedy extinction.

But you must look at this matter in every light.  Though so short a
period ago--not a good lifetime--the census of the buffalo in
Illinois exceeded the census of men now in London, and though at the
present day not one horn or hoof of them remains in all that region;
and though the cause of this wondrous extermination was the spear of
man; yet the far different nature of the whale-hunt peremptorily
forbids so inglorious an end to the Leviathan.  Forty men in one ship
hunting the Sperm Whales for forty-eight months think they have done
extremely well, and thank God, if at last they carry home the oil of
forty fish.  Whereas, in the days of the old Canadian and Indian
hunters and trappers of the West, when the far west (in whose sunset
suns still rise) was a wilderness and a virgin, the same number of
moccasined men, for the same number of months, mounted on horse
instead of sailing in ships, would have slain not forty, but forty
thousand and more buffaloes; a fact that, if need were, could be
statistically stated.

Nor, considered aright, does it seem any argument in favour of the
gradual extinction of the Sperm Whale, for example, that in former
years (the latter part of the last century, say) these Leviathans, in
small pods, were encountered much oftener than at present, and, in
consequence, the voyages were not so prolonged, and were also much
more remunerative.  Because, as has been elsewhere noticed, those
whales, influenced by some views to safety, now swim the seas in
immense caravans, so that to a large degree the scattered solitaries,
yokes, and pods, and schools of other days are now aggregated into
vast but widely separated, unfrequent armies.  That is all.  And
equally fallacious seems the conceit, that because the so-called
whale-bone whales no longer haunt many grounds in former years
abounding with them, hence that species also is declining.  For they
are only being driven from promontory to cape; and if one coast is no
longer enlivened with their jets, then, be sure, some other and
remoter strand has been very recently startled by the unfamiliar
spectacle.

Furthermore: concerning these last mentioned Leviathans, they have
two firm fortresses, which, in all human probability, will for ever
remain impregnable.  And as upon the invasion of their valleys, the
frosty Swiss have retreated to their mountains; so, hunted from the
savannas and glades of the middle seas, the whale-bone whales can at
last resort to their Polar citadels, and diving under the ultimate
glassy barriers and walls there, come up among icy fields and floes;
and in a charmed circle of everlasting December, bid defiance to all
pursuit from man.

But as perhaps fifty of these whale-bone whales are harpooned for one
cachalot, some philosophers of the forecastle have concluded that
this positive havoc has already very seriously diminished their
battalions.  But though for some time past a number of these whales,
not less than 13,000, have been annually slain on the nor'-west
coast by the Americans alone; yet there are considerations which
render even this circumstance of little or no account as an opposing
argument in this matter.

Natural as it is to be somewhat incredulous concerning the
populousness of the more enormous creatures of the globe, yet what
shall we say to Harto, the historian of Goa, when he tells us that at
one hunting the King of Siam took 4,000 elephants; that in those
regions elephants are numerous as droves of cattle in the temperate
climes.  And there seems no reason to doubt that if these elephants,
which have now been hunted for thousands of years, by Semiramis, by
Porus, by Hannibal, and by all the successive monarchs of the
East--if they still survive there in great numbers, much more may the
great whale outlast all hunting, since he has a pasture to expatiate
in, which is precisely twice as large as all Asia, both Americas,
Europe and Africa, New Holland, and all the Isles of the sea
combined.

Moreover: we are to consider, that from the presumed great longevity
of whales, their probably attaining the age of a century and more,
therefore at any one period of time, several distinct adult
generations must be contemporary.  And what that is, we may soon
gain some idea of, by imagining all the grave-yards, cemeteries, and
family vaults of creation yielding up the live bodies of all the men,
women, and children who were alive seventy-five years ago; and adding
this countless host to the present human population of the globe.

Wherefore, for all these things, we account the whale immortal in his
species, however perishable in his individuality.  He swam the seas
before the continents broke water; he once swam over the site of the
Tuileries, and Windsor Castle, and the Kremlin.  In Noah's flood he
despised Noah's Ark; and if ever the world is to be again flooded,
like the Netherlands, to kill off its rats, then the eternal whale
will still survive, and rearing upon the topmost crest of the
equatorial flood, spout his frothed defiance to the skies.



CHAPTER 106

Ahab's Leg.


The precipitating manner in which Captain Ahab had quitted the Samuel
Enderby of London, had not been unattended with some small violence
to his own person.  He had lighted with such energy upon a thwart of
his boat that his ivory leg had received a half-splintering shock.
And when after gaining his own deck, and his own pivot-hole there, he
so vehemently wheeled round with an urgent command to the steersman
(it was, as ever, something about his not steering inflexibly
enough); then, the already shaken ivory received such an additional
twist and wrench, that though it still remained entire, and to all
appearances lusty, yet Ahab did not deem it entirely trustworthy.

And, indeed, it seemed small matter for wonder, that for all his
pervading, mad recklessness, Ahab did at times give careful heed to
the condition of that dead bone upon which he partly stood.  For it
had not been very long prior to the Pequod's sailing from Nantucket,
that he had been found one night lying prone upon the ground, and
insensible; by some unknown, and seemingly inexplicable, unimaginable
casualty, his ivory limb having been so violently displaced, that it
had stake-wise smitten, and all but pierced his groin; nor was it
without extreme difficulty that the agonizing wound was entirely
cured.

Nor, at the time, had it failed to enter his monomaniac mind, that
all the anguish of that then present suffering was but the direct
issue of a former woe; and he too plainly seemed to see, that as the
most poisonous reptile of the marsh perpetuates his kind as
inevitably as the sweetest songster of the grove; so, equally with
every felicity, all miserable events do naturally beget their like.
Yea, more than equally, thought Ahab; since both the ancestry and
posterity of Grief go further than the ancestry and posterity of Joy.
For, not to hint of this: that it is an inference from certain
canonic teachings, that while some natural enjoyments here shall have
no children born to them for the other world, but, on the contrary,
shall be followed by the joy-childlessness of all hell's despair;
whereas, some guilty mortal miseries shall still fertilely beget to
themselves an eternally progressive progeny of griefs beyond the
grave; not at all to hint of this, there still seems an inequality in
the deeper analysis of the thing.  For, thought Ahab, while even the
highest earthly felicities ever have a certain unsignifying pettiness
lurking in them, but, at bottom, all heartwoes, a mystic
significance, and, in some men, an archangelic grandeur; so do their
diligent tracings-out not belie the obvious deduction.  To trail the
genealogies of these high mortal miseries, carries us at last among
the sourceless primogenitures of the gods; so that, in the face of
all the glad, hay-making suns, and soft cymballing, round
harvest-moons, we must needs give in to this: that the gods
themselves are not for ever glad.  The ineffaceable, sad birth-mark
in the brow of man, is but the stamp of sorrow in the signers.

Unwittingly here a secret has been divulged, which perhaps might more
properly, in set way, have been disclosed before.  With many other
particulars concerning Ahab, always had it remained a mystery to
some, why it was, that for a certain period, both before and after
the sailing of the Pequod, he had hidden himself away with such
Grand-Lama-like exclusiveness; and, for that one interval, sought
speechless refuge, as it were, among the marble senate of the dead.
Captain Peleg's bruited reason for this thing appeared by no means
adequate; though, indeed, as touching all Ahab's deeper part, every
revelation partook more of significant darkness than of explanatory
light.  But, in the end, it all came out; this one matter did, at
least.  That direful mishap was at the bottom of his temporary
recluseness.  And not only this, but to that ever-contracting,
dropping circle ashore, who, for any reason, possessed the privilege
of a less banned approach to him; to that timid circle the above
hinted casualty--remaining, as it did, moodily unaccounted for by
Ahab--invested itself with terrors, not entirely underived from the
land of spirits and of wails.  So that, through their zeal for him,
they had all conspired, so far as in them lay, to muffle up the
knowledge of this thing from others; and hence it was, that not till
a considerable interval had elapsed, did it transpire upon the
Pequod's decks.

But be all this as it may; let the unseen, ambiguous synod in the
air, or the vindictive princes and potentates of fire, have to do or
not with earthly Ahab, yet, in this present matter of his leg, he
took plain practical procedures;--he called the carpenter.

And when that functionary appeared before him, he bade him without
delay set about making a new leg, and directed the mates to see him
supplied with all the studs and joists of jaw-ivory (Sperm Whale)
which had thus far been accumulated on the voyage, in order that a
careful selection of the stoutest, clearest-grained stuff might be
secured.  This done, the carpenter received orders to have the leg
completed that night; and to provide all the fittings for it,
independent of those pertaining to the distrusted one in use.
Moreover, the ship's forge was ordered to be hoisted out of its
temporary idleness in the hold; and, to accelerate the affair, the
blacksmith was commanded to proceed at once to the forging of
whatever iron contrivances might be needed.



CHAPTER 107

The Carpenter.


Seat thyself sultanically among the moons of Saturn, and take high
abstracted man alone; and he seems a wonder, a grandeur, and a woe.
But from the same point, take mankind in mass, and for the most part,
they seem a mob of unnecessary duplicates, both contemporary and
hereditary.  But most humble though he was, and far from furnishing
an example of the high, humane abstraction; the Pequod's carpenter
was no duplicate; hence, he now comes in person on this stage.

Like all sea-going ship carpenters, and more especially those
belonging to whaling vessels, he was, to a certain off-handed,
practical extent, alike experienced in numerous trades and callings
collateral to his own; the carpenter's pursuit being the ancient and
outbranching trunk of all those numerous handicrafts which more or
less have to do with wood as an auxiliary material.  But, besides the
application to him of the generic remark above, this carpenter of the
Pequod was singularly efficient in those thousand nameless mechanical
emergencies continually recurring in a large ship, upon a three or
four years' voyage, in uncivilized and far-distant seas.  For not to
speak of his readiness in ordinary duties:--repairing stove boats,
sprung spars, reforming the shape of clumsy-bladed oars, inserting
bull's eyes in the deck, or new tree-nails in the side planks, and
other miscellaneous matters more directly pertaining to his special
business; he was moreover unhesitatingly expert in all manner of
conflicting aptitudes, both useful and capricious.

The one grand stage where he enacted all his various parts so
manifold, was his vice-bench; a long rude ponderous table furnished
with several vices, of different sizes, and both of iron and of wood.
At all times except when whales were alongside, this bench was
securely lashed athwartships against the rear of the Try-works.

A belaying pin is found too large to be easily inserted into its
hole: the carpenter claps it into one of his ever-ready vices, and
straightway files it smaller.  A lost land-bird of strange plumage
strays on board, and is made a captive: out of clean shaved rods of
right-whale bone, and cross-beams of sperm whale ivory, the carpenter
makes a pagoda-looking cage for it.  An oarsman sprains his wrist:
the carpenter concocts a soothing lotion.  Stubb longed for
vermillion stars to be painted upon the blade of his every oar;
screwing each oar in his big vice of wood, the carpenter
symmetrically supplies the constellation.  A sailor takes a fancy to
wear shark-bone ear-rings: the carpenter drills his ears.  Another
has the toothache: the carpenter out pincers, and clapping one hand
upon his bench bids him be seated there; but the poor fellow
unmanageably winces under the unconcluded operation; whirling round
the handle of his wooden vice, the carpenter signs him to clap his
jaw in that, if he would have him draw the tooth.

Thus, this carpenter was prepared at all points, and alike
indifferent and without respect in all.  Teeth he accounted bits of
ivory; heads he deemed but top-blocks; men themselves he lightly held
for capstans.  But while now upon so wide a field thus variously
accomplished and with such liveliness of expertness in him, too; all
this would seem to argue some uncommon vivacity of intelligence.  But
not precisely so.  For nothing was this man more remarkable, than for
a certain impersonal stolidity as it were; impersonal, I say; for it
so shaded off into the surrounding infinite of things, that it seemed
one with the general stolidity discernible in the whole visible
world; which while pauselessly active in uncounted modes, still
eternally holds its peace, and ignores you, though you dig
foundations for cathedrals.  Yet was this half-horrible stolidity in
him, involving, too, as it appeared, an all-ramifying
heartlessness;--yet was it oddly dashed at times, with an old,
crutch-like, antediluvian, wheezing humorousness, not unstreaked now
and then with a certain grizzled wittiness; such as might have served
to pass the time during the midnight watch on the bearded forecastle
of Noah's ark.  Was it that this old carpenter had been a life-long
wanderer, whose much rolling, to and fro, not only had gathered no
moss; but what is more, had rubbed off whatever small outward
clingings might have originally pertained to him?  He was a stript
abstract; an unfractioned integral; uncompromised as a new-born babe;
living without premeditated reference to this world or the next.  You
might almost say, that this strange uncompromisedness in him involved
a sort of unintelligence; for in his numerous trades, he did not seem
to work so much by reason or by instinct, or simply because he had
been tutored to it, or by any intermixture of all these, even or
uneven; but merely by a kind of deaf and dumb, spontaneous literal
process.  He was a pure manipulator; his brain, if he had ever had
one, must have early oozed along into the muscles of his fingers.  He
was like one of those unreasoning but still highly useful, MULTUM IN
PARVO, Sheffield contrivances, assuming the exterior--though a little
swelled--of a common pocket knife; but containing, not only blades of
various sizes, but also screw-drivers, cork-screws, tweezers, awls,
pens, rulers, nail-filers, countersinkers.  So, if his superiors
wanted to use the carpenter for a screw-driver, all they had to do
was to open that part of him, and the screw was fast: or if for
tweezers, take him up by the legs, and there they were.

Yet, as previously hinted, this omnitooled, open-and-shut carpenter,
was, after all, no mere machine of an automaton.  If he did not have
a common soul in him, he had a subtle something that somehow
anomalously did its duty.  What that was, whether essence of
quicksilver, or a few drops of hartshorn, there is no telling.  But
there it was; and there it had abided for now some sixty years or
more.  And this it was, this same unaccountable, cunning
life-principle in him; this it was, that kept him a great part of the
time soliloquizing; but only like an unreasoning wheel, which also
hummingly soliloquizes; or rather, his body was a sentry-box and this
soliloquizer on guard there, and talking all the time to keep himself
awake.

Drat the file, and drat the bone!  That is hard which should be soft,
and that is soft which should be hard.  So we go, who file old jaws
and shinbones.  Let's try another.  Aye, now, this works better
(SNEEZES).  Halloa, this bone dust is (SNEEZES)--why it's
(SNEEZES)--yes it's (SNEEZES)--bless my soul, it won't let me speak!
This is what an old fellow gets now for working in dead lumber.  Saw
a live tree, and you don't get this dust; amputate a live bone, and
you don't get it (SNEEZES).  Come, come, you old Smut, there, bear a
hand, and let's have that ferule and buckle-screw; I'll be ready
for them presently.  Lucky now (SNEEZES) there's no knee-joint to
make; that might puzzle a little; but a mere shinbone--why it's
easy as making hop-poles; only I should like to put a good finish on.
Time, time; if I but only had the time, I could turn him out as neat
a leg now as ever (SNEEZES) scraped to a lady in a parlor.  Those
buckskin legs and calves of legs I've seen in shop windows wouldn't
compare at all.  They soak water, they do; and of course get
rheumatic, and have to be doctored (SNEEZES) with washes and lotions,
just like live legs.  There; before I saw it off, now, I must call his
old Mogulship, and see whether the length will be all right; too
short, if anything, I guess.  Ha! that's the heel; we are in luck;
here he comes, or it's somebody else, that's certain.

AHAB (ADVANCING)

(DURING THE ENSUING SCENE, THE CARPENTER CONTINUES SNEEZING AT TIMES)


Well, manmaker!

Just in time, sir.  If the captain pleases, I will now mark the
length.  Let me measure, sir.

Measured for a leg! good.  Well, it's not the first time.  About it!
There; keep thy finger on it.  This is a cogent vice thou hast here,
carpenter; let me feel its grip once.  So, so; it does pinch some.

Oh, sir, it will break bones--beware, beware!

No fear; I like a good grip; I like to feel something in this
slippery world that can hold, man.  What's Prometheus about
there?--the blacksmith, I mean--what's he about?

He must be forging the buckle-screw, sir, now.

Right.  It's a partnership; he supplies the muscle part.  He makes a
fierce red flame there!

Aye, sir; he must have the white heat for this kind of fine work.

Um-m.  So he must.  I do deem it now a most meaning thing, that that
old Greek, Prometheus, who made men, they say, should have been a
blacksmith, and animated them with fire; for what's made in fire must
properly belong to fire; and so hell's probable.  How the soot flies!
This must be the remainder the Greek made the Africans of.
Carpenter, when he's through with that buckle, tell him to forge a
pair of steel shoulder-blades; there's a pedlar aboard with a
crushing pack.

Sir?

Hold; while Prometheus is about it, I'll order a complete man after a
desirable pattern.  Imprimis, fifty feet high in his socks; then,
chest modelled after the Thames Tunnel; then, legs with roots to 'em,
to stay in one place; then, arms three feet through the wrist; no
heart at all, brass forehead, and about a quarter of an acre of fine
brains; and let me see--shall I order eyes to see outwards?  No, but
put a sky-light on top of his head to illuminate inwards.  There,
take the order, and away.

Now, what's he speaking about, and who's he speaking to, I should
like to know?  Shall I keep standing here? (ASIDE).

'Tis but indifferent architecture to make a blind dome; here's one.
No, no, no; I must have a lantern.

Ho, ho!  That's it, hey?  Here are two, sir; one will serve my turn.

What art thou thrusting that thief-catcher into my face for, man?
Thrusted light is worse than presented pistols.

I thought, sir, that you spoke to carpenter.


Carpenter? why that's--but no;--a very tidy, and, I may say, an
extremely gentlemanlike sort of business thou art in here,
carpenter;--or would'st thou rather work in clay?

Sir?--Clay? clay, sir?  That's mud; we leave clay to ditchers, sir.

The fellow's impious!  What art thou sneezing about?

Bone is rather dusty, sir.

Take the hint, then; and when thou art dead, never bury thyself under
living people's noses.

Sir?--oh! ah!--I guess so;--yes--dear!

Look ye, carpenter, I dare say thou callest thyself a right good
workmanlike workman, eh?  Well, then, will it speak thoroughly well
for thy work, if, when I come to mount this leg thou makest, I shall
nevertheless feel another leg in the same identical place with it;
that is, carpenter, my old lost leg; the flesh and blood one, I mean.
Canst thou not drive that old Adam away?

Truly, sir, I begin to understand somewhat now.  Yes, I have heard
something curious on that score, sir; how that a dismasted man never
entirely loses the feeling of his old spar, but it will be still
pricking him at times.  May I humbly ask if it be really so, sir?

It is, man.  Look, put thy live leg here in the place where mine once
was; so, now, here is only one distinct leg to the eye, yet two to
the soul.  Where thou feelest tingling life; there, exactly there,
there to a hair, do I.  Is't a riddle?

I should humbly call it a poser, sir.

Hist, then.  How dost thou know that some entire, living, thinking
thing may not be invisibly and uninterpenetratingly standing
precisely where thou now standest; aye, and standing there in thy
spite?  In thy most solitary hours, then, dost thou not fear
eavesdroppers?  Hold, don't speak!  And if I still feel the smart of
my crushed leg, though it be now so long dissolved; then, why mayst
not thou, carpenter, feel the fiery pains of hell for ever, and
without a body?  Hah!

Good Lord!  Truly, sir, if it comes to that, I must calculate over
again; I think I didn't carry a small figure, sir.

Look ye, pudding-heads should never grant premises.--How long before
the leg is done?

Perhaps an hour, sir.

Bungle away at it then, and bring it to me (TURNS TO GO).  Oh, Life!
Here I am, proud as Greek god, and yet standing debtor to this
blockhead for a bone to stand on!  Cursed be that mortal
inter-indebtedness which will not do away with ledgers.  I would be
free as air; and I'm down in the whole world's books.  I am so rich,
I could have given bid for bid with the wealthiest Praetorians at the
auction of the Roman empire (which was the world's); and yet I owe
for the flesh in the tongue I brag with.  By heavens!  I'll get a
crucible, and into it, and dissolve myself down to one small,
compendious vertebra.  So.

CARPENTER (RESUMING HIS WORK).


Well, well, well!  Stubb knows him best of all, and Stubb always says
he's queer; says nothing but that one sufficient little word queer;
he's queer, says Stubb; he's queer--queer, queer; and keeps dinning
it into Mr. Starbuck all the time--queer--sir--queer, queer, very
queer.  And here's his leg!  Yes, now that I think of it, here's his
bedfellow! has a stick of whale's jaw-bone for a wife!  And this is
his leg; he'll stand on this.  What was that now about one leg
standing in three places, and all three places standing in one
hell--how was that?  Oh!  I don't wonder he looked so scornful at me!
I'm a sort of strange-thoughted sometimes, they say; but that's only
haphazard-like.  Then, a short, little old body like me, should never
undertake to wade out into deep waters with tall, heron-built
captains; the water chucks you under the chin pretty quick, and
there's a great cry for life-boats.  And here's the heron's leg! long
and slim, sure enough!  Now, for most folks one pair of legs lasts a
lifetime, and that must be because they use them mercifully, as a
tender-hearted old lady uses her roly-poly old coach-horses.  But
Ahab; oh he's a hard driver.  Look, driven one leg to death, and
spavined the other for life, and now wears out bone legs by the cord.
Halloa, there, you Smut! bear a hand there with those screws, and
let's finish it before the resurrection fellow comes a-calling with
his horn for all legs, true or false, as brewery-men go round
collecting old beer barrels, to fill 'em up again.  What a leg this
is!  It looks like a real live leg, filed down to nothing but the
core; he'll be standing on this to-morrow; he'll be taking altitudes
on it.  Halloa!  I almost forgot the little oval slate, smoothed
ivory, where he figures up the latitude.  So, so; chisel, file, and
sand-paper, now!



CHAPTER 109

Ahab and Starbuck in the Cabin.


According to usage they were pumping the ship next morning; and lo!
no inconsiderable oil came up with the water; the casks below must
have sprung a bad leak.  Much concern was shown; and Starbuck went
down into the cabin to report this unfavourable affair.*


*In Sperm-whalemen with any considerable quantity of oil on board, it
is a regular semiweekly duty to conduct a hose into the hold, and
drench the casks with sea-water; which afterwards, at varying
intervals, is removed by the ship's pumps.  Hereby the casks are
sought to be kept damply tight; while by the changed character of the
withdrawn water, the mariners readily detect any serious leakage in
the precious cargo.


Now, from the South and West the Pequod was drawing nigh to Formosa
and the Bashee Isles, between which lies one of the tropical outlets
from the China waters into the Pacific.  And so Starbuck found Ahab
with a general chart of the oriental archipelagoes spread before him;
and another separate one representing the long eastern coasts of the
Japanese islands--Niphon, Matsmai, and Sikoke.  With his snow-white
new ivory leg braced against the screwed leg of his table, and with a
long pruning-hook of a jack-knife in his hand, the wondrous old man,
with his back to the gangway door, was wrinkling his brow, and
tracing his old courses again.

Who's there? hearing the footstep at the door, but not turning
round to it.  On deck!  Begone!

Captain Ahab mistakes; it is I.  The oil in the hold is leaking,"
7925	"sir.  We must up Burtons and break out.

Up Burtons and break out?  Now that we are nearing Japan; heave-to"
7926	"here for a week to tinker a parcel of old hoops?

Either do that, sir, or waste in one day more oil than we may make"
7927	good in a year.  What we come twenty thousand miles to get is worth
7928	"saving, sir.

So it is, so it is; if we get it.

I was speaking of the oil in the hold, sir.

And I was not speaking or thinking of that at all.  Begone!  Let it"
7929	leak!  I'm all aleak myself.  Aye! leaks in leaks! not only full of
7930	leaky casks, but those leaky casks are in a leaky ship; and that's a
7931	far worse plight than the Pequod's, man.  Yet I don't stop to plug my
7932	leak; for who can find it in the deep-loaded hull; or how hope to
7933	plug it, even if found, in this life's howling gale?  Starbuck!
7934	"I'll not have the Burtons hoisted.

What will the owners say, sir?

Let the owners stand on Nantucket beach and outyell the Typhoons."
7935	What cares Ahab?  Owners, owners?  Thou art always prating to me,
7936	Starbuck, about those miserly owners, as if the owners were my
7937	conscience.  But look ye, the only real owner of anything is its
7938	commander; and hark ye, my conscience is in this ship's keel.--On
7939	"deck!

Captain Ahab, said the reddening mate, moving further into the
cabin, with a daring so strangely respectful and cautious that it
almost seemed not only every way seeking to avoid the slightest
outward manifestation of itself, but within also seemed more than
half distrustful of itself; A better man than I might well pass over"
7940	in thee what he would quickly enough resent in a younger man; aye,
7941	"and in a happier, Captain Ahab.

Devils!  Dost thou then so much as dare to critically think of"
7942	"me?--On deck!

Nay, sir, not yet; I do entreat.  And I do dare, sir--to be"
7943	forbearing!  Shall we not understand each other better than hitherto,
7944	"Captain Ahab?

Ahab seized a loaded musket from the rack (forming part of most
South-Sea-men's cabin furniture), and pointing it towards Starbuck,
exclaimed: There is one God that is Lord over the earth, and one"
7945	"Captain that is lord over the Pequod.--On deck!

For an instant in the flashing eyes of the mate, and his fiery
cheeks, you would have almost thought that he had really received the
blaze of the levelled tube.  But, mastering his emotion, he half
calmly rose, and as he quitted the cabin, paused for an instant and
said: Thou hast outraged, not insulted me, sir; but for that I ask"
7946	thee not to beware of Starbuck; thou wouldst but laugh; but let Ahab
7947	"beware of Ahab; beware of thyself, old man.

He waxes brave, but nevertheless obeys; most careful bravery that!
murmured Ahab, as Starbuck disappeared.  What's that he said--Ahab"
7948	"beware of Ahab--there's something there!  Then unconsciously using
the musket for a staff, with an iron brow he paced to and fro in the
little cabin; but presently the thick plaits of his forehead relaxed,
and returning the gun to the rack, he went to the deck.

Thou art but too good a fellow, Starbuck, he said lowly to the
mate; then raising his voice to the crew: Furl the t'gallant-sails,"
7949	and close-reef the top-sails, fore and aft; back the main-yard; up
7950	"Burton, and break out in the main-hold.

It were perhaps vain to surmise exactly why it was, that as
respecting Starbuck, Ahab thus acted.  It may have been a flash of
honesty in him; or mere prudential policy which, under the
circumstance, imperiously forbade the slightest symptom of open
disaffection, however transient, in the important chief officer of
his ship.  However it was, his orders were executed; and the Burtons
were hoisted.



CHAPTER 110

Queequeg in His Coffin.


Upon searching, it was found that the casks last struck into the hold
were perfectly sound, and that the leak must be further off.  So, it
being calm weather, they broke out deeper and deeper, disturbing the
slumbers of the huge ground-tier butts; and from that black midnight
sending those gigantic moles into the daylight above.  So deep did
they go; and so ancient, and corroded, and weedy the aspect of the
lowermost puncheons, that you almost looked next for some mouldy
corner-stone cask containing coins of Captain Noah, with copies of
the posted placards, vainly warning the infatuated old world from the
flood.  Tierce after tierce, too, of water, and bread, and beef, and
shooks of staves, and iron bundles of hoops, were hoisted out, till
at last the piled decks were hard to get about; and the hollow hull
echoed under foot, as if you were treading over empty catacombs, and
reeled and rolled in the sea like an air-freighted demijohn.
Top-heavy was the ship as a dinnerless student with all Aristotle in
his head.  Well was it that the Typhoons did not visit them then.

Now, at this time it was that my poor pagan companion, and fast
bosom-friend, Queequeg, was seized with a fever, which brought him
nigh to his endless end.

Be it said, that in this vocation of whaling, sinecures are unknown;
dignity and danger go hand in hand; till you get to be Captain, the
higher you rise the harder you toil.  So with poor Queequeg, who, as
harpooneer, must not only face all the rage of the living whale,
but--as we have elsewhere seen--mount his dead back in a rolling sea;
and finally descend into the gloom of the hold, and bitterly sweating
all day in that subterraneous confinement, resolutely manhandle the
clumsiest casks and see to their stowage.  To be short, among
whalemen, the harpooneers are the holders, so called.

Poor Queequeg! when the ship was about half disembowelled, you should
have stooped over the hatchway, and peered down upon him there;
where, stripped to his woollen drawers, the tattooed savage was
crawling about amid that dampness and slime, like a green spotted
lizard at the bottom of a well.  And a well, or an ice-house, it
somehow proved to him, poor pagan; where, strange to say, for all the
heat of his sweatings, he caught a terrible chill which lapsed into a
fever; and at last, after some days' suffering, laid him in his
hammock, close to the very sill of the door of death.  How he wasted
and wasted away in those few long-lingering days, till there seemed
but little left of him but his frame and tattooing.  But as all else
in him thinned, and his cheek-bones grew sharper, his eyes,
nevertheless, seemed growing fuller and fuller; they became of a
strange softness of lustre; and mildly but deeply looked out at you
there from his sickness, a wondrous testimony to that immortal health
in him which could not die, or be weakened.  And like circles on the
water, which, as they grow fainter, expand; so his eyes seemed
rounding and rounding, like the rings of Eternity.  An awe that
cannot be named would steal over you as you sat by the side of this
waning savage, and saw as strange things in his face, as any beheld
who were bystanders when Zoroaster died.  For whatever is truly
wondrous and fearful in man, never yet was put into words or books.
And the drawing near of Death, which alike levels all, alike
impresses all with a last revelation, which only an author from the
dead could adequately tell.  So that--let us say it again--no dying
Chaldee or Greek had higher and holier thoughts than those, whose
mysterious shades you saw creeping over the face of poor Queequeg, as
he quietly lay in his swaying hammock, and the rolling sea seemed
gently rocking him to his final rest, and the ocean's invisible
flood-tide lifted him higher and higher towards his destined heaven.

Not a man of the crew but gave him up; and, as for Queequeg himself,
what he thought of his case was forcibly shown by a curious favour he
asked.  He called one to him in the grey morning watch, when the day
was just breaking, and taking his hand, said that while in Nantucket
he had chanced to see certain little canoes of dark wood, like the
rich war-wood of his native isle; and upon inquiry, he had learned
that all whalemen who died in Nantucket, were laid in those same dark
canoes, and that the fancy of being so laid had much pleased him; for
it was not unlike the custom of his own race, who, after embalming a
dead warrior, stretched him out in his canoe, and so left him to be
floated away to the starry archipelagoes; for not only do they
believe that the stars are isles, but that far beyond all visible
horizons, their own mild, uncontinented seas, interflow with the blue
heavens; and so form the white breakers of the milky way.  He added,
that he shuddered at the thought of being buried in his hammock,
according to the usual sea-custom, tossed like something vile to the
death-devouring sharks.  No: he desired a canoe like those of
Nantucket, all the more congenial to him, being a whaleman, that like
a whale-boat these coffin-canoes were without a keel; though that
involved but uncertain steering, and much lee-way adown the dim ages.

Now, when this strange circumstance was made known aft, the carpenter
was at once commanded to do Queequeg's bidding, whatever it might
include.  There was some heathenish, coffin-coloured old lumber
aboard, which, upon a long previous voyage, had been cut from the
aboriginal groves of the Lackaday islands, and from these dark planks
the coffin was recommended to be made.  No sooner was the carpenter
apprised of the order, than taking his rule, he forthwith with all
the indifferent promptitude of his character, proceeded into the
forecastle and took Queequeg's measure with great accuracy, regularly
chalking Queequeg's person as he shifted the rule.

Ah! poor fellow! he'll have to die now, ejaculated the Long Island
sailor.

Going to his vice-bench, the carpenter for convenience sake and
general reference, now transferringly measured on it the exact length
the coffin was to be, and then made the transfer permanent by cutting
two notches at its extremities.  This done, he marshalled the planks
and his tools, and to work.

When the last nail was driven, and the lid duly planed and fitted, he
lightly shouldered the coffin and went forward with it, inquiring
whether they were ready for it yet in that direction.

Overhearing the indignant but half-humorous cries with which the
people on deck began to drive the coffin away, Queequeg, to every
one's consternation, commanded that the thing should be instantly
brought to him, nor was there any denying him; seeing that, of all
mortals, some dying men are the most tyrannical; and certainly, since
they will shortly trouble us so little for evermore, the poor fellows
ought to be indulged.

Leaning over in his hammock, Queequeg long regarded the coffin with
an attentive eye.  He then called for his harpoon, had the wooden
stock drawn from it, and then had the iron part placed in the coffin
along with one of the paddles of his boat.  All by his own request,
also, biscuits were then ranged round the sides within: a flask of
fresh water was placed at the head, and a small bag of woody earth
scraped up in the hold at the foot; and a piece of sail-cloth being
rolled up for a pillow, Queequeg now entreated to be lifted into his
final bed, that he might make trial of its comforts, if any it had.
He lay without moving a few minutes, then told one to go to his bag
and bring out his little god, Yojo.  Then crossing his arms on his
breast with Yojo between, he called for the coffin lid (hatch he
called it) to be placed over him.  The head part turned over with a
leather hinge, and there lay Queequeg in his coffin with little but
his composed countenance in view.  Rarmai (it will do; it is easy),
he murmured at last, and signed to be replaced in his hammock.

But ere this was done, Pip, who had been slily hovering near by all
this while, drew nigh to him where he lay, and with soft sobbings,
took him by the hand; in the other, holding his tambourine.

Poor rover! will ye never have done with all this weary roving?"
7951	where go ye now?  But if the currents carry ye to those sweet
7952	Antilles where the beaches are only beat with water-lilies, will ye
7953	do one little errand for me?  Seek out one Pip, who's now been
7954	missing long: I think he's in those far Antilles.  If ye find him,
7955	then comfort him; for he must be very sad; for look! he's left his
7956	tambourine behind;--I found it.  Rig-a-dig, dig, dig!  Now, Queequeg,
7957	"die; and I'll beat ye your dying march.

I have heard, murmured Starbuck, gazing down the scuttle, that in"
7958	violent fevers, men, all ignorance, have talked in ancient tongues;
7959	and that when the mystery is probed, it turns out always that in
7960	their wholly forgotten childhood those ancient tongues had been
7961	really spoken in their hearing by some lofty scholars.  So, to my
7962	fond faith, poor Pip, in this strange sweetness of his lunacy, brings
7963	heavenly vouchers of all our heavenly homes.  Where learned he that,
7964	"but there?--Hark! he speaks again: but more wildly now.

Form two and two!  Let's make a General of him!  Ho, where's his"
7965	harpoon?  Lay it across here.--Rig-a-dig, dig, dig! huzza!  Oh for a
7966	game cock now to sit upon his head and crow!  Queequeg dies
7967	game!--mind ye that; Queequeg dies game!--take ye good heed of that;
7968	Queequeg dies game!  I say; game, game, game! but base little Pip, he
7969	died a coward; died all a'shiver;--out upon Pip!  Hark ye; if ye find
7970	Pip, tell all the Antilles he's a runaway; a coward, a coward, a
7971	coward!  Tell them he jumped from a whale-boat!  I'd never beat my
7972	tambourine over base Pip, and hail him General, if he were once more
7973	dying here.  No, no! shame upon all cowards--shame upon them!  Let 'em
7974	"go drown like Pip, that jumped from a whale-boat.  Shame! shame!

During all this, Queequeg lay with closed eyes, as if in a dream.
Pip was led away, and the sick man was replaced in his hammock.

But now that he had apparently made every preparation for death; now
that his coffin was proved a good fit, Queequeg suddenly rallied;
soon there seemed no need of the carpenter's box: and thereupon,
when some expressed their delighted surprise, he, in substance, said,
that the cause of his sudden convalescence was this;--at a critical
moment, he had just recalled a little duty ashore, which he was
leaving undone; and therefore had changed his mind about dying: he
could not die yet, he averred.  They asked him, then, whether to live
or die was a matter of his own sovereign will and pleasure.  He
answered, certainly.  In a word, it was Queequeg's conceit, that if a
man made up his mind to live, mere sickness could not kill him:
nothing but a whale, or a gale, or some violent, ungovernable,
unintelligent destroyer of that sort.

Now, there is this noteworthy difference between savage and
civilized; that while a sick, civilized man may be six months
convalescing, generally speaking, a sick savage is almost half-well
again in a day.  So, in good time my Queequeg gained strength; and at
length after sitting on the windlass for a few indolent days (but
eating with a vigorous appetite) he suddenly leaped to his feet,
threw out his arms and legs, gave himself a good stretching, yawned
a little bit, and then springing into the head of his hoisted boat,
and poising a harpoon, pronounced himself fit for a fight.

With a wild whimsiness, he now used his coffin for a sea-chest; and
emptying into it his canvas bag of clothes, set them in order there.
Many spare hours he spent, in carving the lid with all manner of
grotesque figures and drawings; and it seemed that hereby he was
striving, in his rude way, to copy parts of the twisted tattooing on
his body.  And this tattooing had been the work of a departed
prophet and seer of his island, who, by those hieroglyphic marks, had
written out on his body a complete theory of the heavens and the
earth, and a mystical treatise on the art of attaining truth; so that
Queequeg in his own proper person was a riddle to unfold; a wondrous
work in one volume; but whose mysteries not even himself could read,
though his own live heart beat against them; and these mysteries were
therefore destined in the end to moulder away with the living
parchment whereon they were inscribed, and so be unsolved to the
last.  And this thought it must have been which suggested to Ahab
that wild exclamation of his, when one morning turning away from
surveying poor Queequeg--Oh, devilish tantalization of the gods!



CHAPTER 111

The Pacific.


When gliding by the Bashee isles we emerged at last upon the great
South Sea; were it not for other things, I could have greeted my dear
Pacific with uncounted thanks, for now the long supplication of my
youth was answered; that serene ocean rolled eastwards from me a
thousand leagues of blue.

There is, one knows not what sweet mystery about this sea, whose
gently awful stirrings seem to speak of some hidden soul beneath;
like those fabled undulations of the Ephesian sod over the buried
Evangelist St. John.  And meet it is, that over these sea-pastures,
wide-rolling watery prairies and Potters' Fields of all four
continents, the waves should rise and fall, and ebb and flow
unceasingly; for here, millions of mixed shades and shadows, drowned
dreams, somnambulisms, reveries; all that we call lives and souls,
lie dreaming, dreaming, still; tossing like slumberers in their beds;
the ever-rolling waves but made so by their restlessness.

To any meditative Magian rover, this serene Pacific, once beheld,
must ever after be the sea of his adoption.  It rolls the midmost
waters of the world, the Indian ocean and Atlantic being but its
arms.  The same waves wash the moles of the new-built Californian
towns, but yesterday planted by the recentest race of men, and lave
the faded but still gorgeous skirts of Asiatic lands, older than
Abraham; while all between float milky-ways of coral isles, and
low-lying, endless, unknown Archipelagoes, and impenetrable Japans.
Thus this mysterious, divine Pacific zones the world's whole bulk
about; makes all coasts one bay to it; seems the tide-beating heart
of earth.  Lifted by those eternal swells, you needs must own the
seductive god, bowing your head to Pan.

But few thoughts of Pan stirred Ahab's brain, as standing like an
iron statue at his accustomed place beside the mizen rigging, with
one nostril he unthinkingly snuffed the sugary musk from the Bashee
isles (in whose sweet woods mild lovers must be walking), and with
the other consciously inhaled the salt breath of the new found sea;
that sea in which the hated White Whale must even then be swimming.
Launched at length upon these almost final waters, and gliding
towards the Japanese cruising-ground, the old man's purpose
intensified itself.  His firm lips met like the lips of a vice; the
Delta of his forehead's veins swelled like overladen brooks; in his
very sleep, his ringing cry ran through the vaulted hull, Stern all!"
7975	"the White Whale spouts thick blood!



CHAPTER 112

The Blacksmith.


Availing himself of the mild, summer-cool weather that now reigned
in these latitudes, and in preparation for the peculiarly active
pursuits shortly to be anticipated, Perth, the begrimed, blistered
old blacksmith, had not removed his portable forge to the hold again,
after concluding his contributory work for Ahab's leg, but still
retained it on deck, fast lashed to ringbolts by the foremast; being
now almost incessantly invoked by the headsmen, and harpooneers, and
bowsmen to do some little job for them; altering, or repairing, or
new shaping their various weapons and boat furniture.  Often he would
be surrounded by an eager circle, all waiting to be served; holding
boat-spades, pike-heads, harpoons, and lances, and jealously watching
his every sooty movement, as he toiled.  Nevertheless, this old man's
was a patient hammer wielded by a patient arm.  No murmur, no
impatience, no petulance did come from him.  Silent, slow, and
solemn; bowing over still further his chronically broken back, he
toiled away, as if toil were life itself, and the heavy beating of
his hammer the heavy beating of his heart.  And so it was.--Most
miserable!

A peculiar walk in this old man, a certain slight but painful
appearing yawing in his gait, had at an early period of the voyage
excited the curiosity of the mariners.  And to the importunity of
their persisted questionings he had finally given in; and so it came
to pass that every one now knew the shameful story of his wretched
fate.

Belated, and not innocently, one bitter winter's midnight, on the
road running between two country towns, the blacksmith half-stupidly
felt the deadly numbness stealing over him, and sought refuge in a
leaning, dilapidated barn.  The issue was, the loss of the
extremities of both feet.  Out of this revelation, part by part, at
last came out the four acts of the gladness, and the one long, and as
yet uncatastrophied fifth act of the grief of his life's drama.

He was an old man, who, at the age of nearly sixty, had postponedly
encountered that thing in sorrow's technicals called ruin.  He had
been an artisan of famed excellence, and with plenty to do; owned a
house and garden; embraced a youthful, daughter-like, loving wife,
and three blithe, ruddy children; every Sunday went to a
cheerful-looking church, planted in a grove.  But one night, under
cover of darkness, and further concealed in a most cunning
disguisement, a desperate burglar slid into his happy home, and
robbed them all of everything.  And darker yet to tell, the
blacksmith himself did ignorantly conduct this burglar into his
family's heart.  It was the Bottle Conjuror!  Upon the opening of
that fatal cork, forth flew the fiend, and shrivelled up his home.
Now, for prudent, most wise, and economic reasons, the blacksmith's
shop was in the basement of his dwelling, but with a separate
entrance to it; so that always had the young and loving healthy wife
listened with no unhappy nervousness, but with vigorous pleasure, to
the stout ringing of her young-armed old husband's hammer; whose
reverberations, muffled by passing through the floors and walls, came
up to her, not unsweetly, in her nursery; and so, to stout Labor's
iron lullaby, the blacksmith's infants were rocked to slumber.

Oh, woe on woe!  Oh, Death, why canst thou not sometimes be timely?
Hadst thou taken this old blacksmith to thyself ere his full ruin
came upon him, then had the young widow had a delicious grief, and
her orphans a truly venerable, legendary sire to dream of in their
after years; and all of them a care-killing competency.  But Death
plucked down some virtuous elder brother, on whose whistling daily
toil solely hung the responsibilities of some other family, and left
the worse than useless old man standing, till the hideous rot of life
should make him easier to harvest.

Why tell the whole?  The blows of the basement hammer every day grew
more and more between; and each blow every day grew fainter than the
last; the wife sat frozen at the window, with tearless eyes,
glitteringly gazing into the weeping faces of her children; the
bellows fell; the forge choked up with cinders; the house was sold;
the mother dived down into the long church-yard grass; her children
twice followed her thither; and the houseless, familyless old man
staggered off a vagabond in crape; his every woe unreverenced; his
grey head a scorn to flaxen curls!

Death seems the only desirable sequel for a career like this; but
Death is only a launching into the region of the strange Untried; it
is but the first salutation to the possibilities of the immense
Remote, the Wild, the Watery, the Unshored; therefore, to the
death-longing eyes of such men, who still have left in them some
interior compunctions against suicide, does the all-contributed and
all-receptive ocean alluringly spread forth his whole plain of
unimaginable, taking terrors, and wonderful, new-life adventures; and
from the hearts of infinite Pacifics, the thousand mermaids sing to
them--Come hither, broken-hearted; here is another life without the"
7976	guilt of intermediate death; here are wonders supernatural, without
7977	dying for them.  Come hither! bury thyself in a life which, to your
7978	now equally abhorred and abhorring, landed world, is more oblivious
7979	than death.  Come hither! put up THY gravestone, too, within the
7980	"churchyard, and come hither, till we marry thee!

Hearkening to these voices, East and West, by early sunrise, and by
fall of eve, the blacksmith's soul responded, Aye, I come!  And so
Perth went a-whaling.



CHAPTER 113

The Forge.


With matted beard, and swathed in a bristling shark-skin apron, about
mid-day, Perth was standing between his forge and anvil, the latter
placed upon an iron-wood log, with one hand holding a pike-head in
the coals, and with the other at his forge's lungs, when Captain Ahab
came along, carrying in his hand a small rusty-looking leathern bag.
While yet a little distance from the forge, moody Ahab paused; till
at last, Perth, withdrawing his iron from the fire, began hammering
it upon the anvil--the red mass sending off the sparks in thick
hovering flights, some of which flew close to Ahab.

Are these thy Mother Carey's chickens, Perth? they are always flying"
7981	in thy wake; birds of good omen, too, but not to all;--look here,
7982	"they burn; but thou--thou liv'st among them without a scorch.

Because I am scorched all over, Captain Ahab, answered Perth,
resting for a moment on his hammer; I am past scorching; not easily"
7983	"can'st thou scorch a scar.

Well, well; no more.  Thy shrunk voice sounds too calmly, sanely"
7984	woeful to me.  In no Paradise myself, I am impatient of all misery in
7985	others that is not mad.  Thou should'st go mad, blacksmith; say, why
7986	dost thou not go mad?  How can'st thou endure without being mad?  Do
7987	the heavens yet hate thee, that thou can'st not go mad?--What wert
7988	"thou making there?

Welding an old pike-head, sir; there were seams and dents in it.

And can'st thou make it all smooth again, blacksmith, after such"
7989	"hard usage as it had?

I think so, sir.

And I suppose thou can'st smoothe almost any seams and dents; never"
7990	"mind how hard the metal, blacksmith?

Aye, sir, I think I can; all seams and dents but one.

Look ye here, then, cried Ahab, passionately advancing, and leaning
with both hands on Perth's shoulders; look ye here--HERE--can ye"
7991	"smoothe out a seam like this, blacksmith, sweeping one hand across
his ribbed brow; if thou could'st, blacksmith, glad enough would I"
7992	lay my head upon thy anvil, and feel thy heaviest hammer between my
7993	"eyes.  Answer!  Can'st thou smoothe this seam?

Oh! that is the one, sir!  Said I not all seams and dents but one?

Aye, blacksmith, it is the one; aye, man, it is unsmoothable; for"
7994	though thou only see'st it here in my flesh, it has worked down into
7995	the bone of my skull--THAT is all wrinkles!  But, away with child's
7996	"play; no more gaffs and pikes to-day.  Look ye here! jingling the
leathern bag, as if it were full of gold coins.  I, too, want a"
7997	harpoon made; one that a thousand yoke of fiends could not part,
7998	Perth; something that will stick in a whale like his own fin-bone.
7999	There's the stuff, flinging the pouch upon the anvil.  Look ye,
8000	blacksmith, these are the gathered nail-stubbs of the steel shoes of
8001	"racing horses.

Horse-shoe stubbs, sir?  Why, Captain Ahab, thou hast here, then,"
8002	"the best and stubbornest stuff we blacksmiths ever work.

I know it, old man; these stubbs will weld together like glue from"
8003	the melted bones of murderers.  Quick! forge me the harpoon.  And
8004	forge me first, twelve rods for its shank; then wind, and twist, and
8005	hammer these twelve together like the yarns and strands of a
8006	"tow-line.  Quick!  I'll blow the fire.

When at last the twelve rods were made, Ahab tried them, one by one,
by spiralling them, with his own hand, round a long, heavy iron bolt.
A flaw! rejecting the last one.  Work that over again, Perth.

This done, Perth was about to begin welding the twelve into one, when
Ahab stayed his hand, and said he would weld his own iron.  As, then,
with regular, gasping hems, he hammered on the anvil, Perth passing
to him the glowing rods, one after the other, and the hard pressed
forge shooting up its intense straight flame, the Parsee passed
silently, and bowing over his head towards the fire, seemed invoking
some curse or some blessing on the toil.  But, as Ahab looked up, he
slid aside.

What's that bunch of lucifers dodging about there for? muttered
Stubb, looking on from the forecastle.  That Parsee smells fire like"
8007	"a fusee; and smells of it himself, like a hot musket's powder-pan.

At last the shank, in one complete rod, received its final heat; and
as Perth, to temper it, plunged it all hissing into the cask of water
near by, the scalding steam shot up into Ahab's bent face.

Would'st thou brand me, Perth? wincing for a moment with the pain;
have I been but forging my own branding-iron, then?

Pray God, not that; yet I fear something, Captain Ahab.  Is not this"
8008	"harpoon for the White Whale?

For the white fiend!  But now for the barbs; thou must make them"
8009	thyself, man.  Here are my razors--the best of steel; here, and make
8010	"the barbs sharp as the needle-sleet of the Icy Sea.

For a moment, the old blacksmith eyed the razors as though he would
fain not use them.

Take them, man, I have no need for them; for I now neither shave,"
8011	"sup, nor pray till--but here--to work!

Fashioned at last into an arrowy shape, and welded by Perth to the
shank, the steel soon pointed the end of the iron; and as the
blacksmith was about giving the barbs their final heat, prior to
tempering them, he cried to Ahab to place the water-cask near.

No, no--no water for that; I want it of the true death-temper."
8012	Ahoy, there!  Tashtego, Queequeg, Daggoo!  What say ye, pagans!  Will
8013	"ye give me as much blood as will cover this barb? holding it high
up.  A cluster of dark nods replied, Yes.  Three punctures were made
in the heathen flesh, and the White Whale's barbs were then tempered.

Ego non baptizo te in nomine patris, sed in nomine diaboli!
deliriously howled Ahab, as the malignant iron scorchingly devoured
the baptismal blood.

Now, mustering the spare poles from below, and selecting one of
hickory, with the bark still investing it, Ahab fitted the end to the
socket of the iron.  A coil of new tow-line was then unwound, and
some fathoms of it taken to the windlass, and stretched to a great
tension.  Pressing his foot upon it, till the rope hummed like a
harp-string, then eagerly bending over it, and seeing no strandings,
Ahab exclaimed, Good! and now for the seizings.

At one extremity the rope was unstranded, and the separate spread
yarns were all braided and woven round the socket of the harpoon; the
pole was then driven hard up into the socket; from the lower end the
rope was traced half-way along the pole's length, and firmly secured
so, with intertwistings of twine.  This done, pole, iron, and
rope--like the Three Fates--remained inseparable, and Ahab moodily
stalked away with the weapon; the sound of his ivory leg, and the
sound of the hickory pole, both hollowly ringing along every plank.
But ere he entered his cabin, light, unnatural, half-bantering, yet
most piteous sound was heard.  Oh, Pip! thy wretched laugh, thy
idle but unresting eye; all thy strange mummeries not unmeaningly
blended with the black tragedy of the melancholy ship, and mocked it!



CHAPTER 114

The Gilder.


Penetrating further and further into the heart of the Japanese
cruising ground, the Pequod was soon all astir in the fishery.
Often, in mild, pleasant weather, for twelve, fifteen, eighteen, and
twenty hours on the stretch, they were engaged in the boats, steadily
pulling, or sailing, or paddling after the whales, or for an
interlude of sixty or seventy minutes calmly awaiting their uprising;
though with but small success for their pains.

At such times, under an abated sun; afloat all day upon smooth, slow
heaving swells; seated in his boat, light as a birch canoe; and so
sociably mixing with the soft waves themselves, that like
hearth-stone cats they purr against the gunwale; these are the times
of dreamy quietude, when beholding the tranquil beauty and brilliancy
of the ocean's skin, one forgets the tiger heart that pants beneath
it; and would not willingly remember, that this velvet paw but
conceals a remorseless fang.

These are the times, when in his whale-boat the rover softly feels a
certain filial, confident, land-like feeling towards the sea; that he
regards it as so much flowery earth; and the distant ship revealing
only the tops of her masts, seems struggling forward, not through
high rolling waves, but through the tall grass of a rolling prairie:
as when the western emigrants' horses only show their erected ears,
while their hidden bodies widely wade through the amazing verdure.

The long-drawn virgin vales; the mild blue hill-sides; as over these
there steals the hush, the hum; you almost swear that play-wearied
children lie sleeping in these solitudes, in some glad May-time, when
the flowers of the woods are plucked.  And all this mixes with your
most mystic mood; so that fact and fancy, half-way meeting,
interpenetrate, and form one seamless whole.

Nor did such soothing scenes, however temporary, fail of at least as
temporary an effect on Ahab.  But if these secret golden keys did
seem to open in him his own secret golden treasuries, yet did his
breath upon them prove but tarnishing.

Oh, grassy glades! oh, ever vernal endless landscapes in the soul; in
ye,--though long parched by the dead drought of the earthy
life,--in ye, men yet may roll, like young horses in new morning
clover; and for some few fleeting moments, feel the cool dew of the
life immortal on them.  Would to God these blessed calms would last.
But the mingled, mingling threads of life are woven by warp and woof:
calms crossed by storms, a storm for every calm.  There is no steady
unretracing progress in this life; we do not advance through fixed
gradations, and at the last one pause:--through infancy's unconscious
spell, boyhood's thoughtless faith, adolescence' doubt (the common
doom), then scepticism, then disbelief, resting at last in manhood's
pondering repose of If.  But once gone through, we trace the round
again; and are infants, boys, and men, and Ifs eternally.  Where lies
the final harbor, whence we unmoor no more?  In what rapt ether sails
the world, of which the weariest will never weary?  Where is the
foundling's father hidden?  Our souls are like those orphans whose
unwedded mothers die in bearing them: the secret of our paternity
lies in their grave, and we must there to learn it.

And that same day, too, gazing far down from his boat's side into
that same golden sea, Starbuck lowly murmured:--

Loveliness unfathomable, as ever lover saw in his young bride's"
8014	eye!--Tell me not of thy teeth-tiered sharks, and thy kidnapping
8015	cannibal ways.  Let faith oust fact; let fancy oust memory; I look
8016	"deep down and do believe.

And Stubb, fish-like, with sparkling scales, leaped up in that same
golden light:--

I am Stubb, and Stubb has his history; but here Stubb takes oaths"
8017	"that he has always been jolly!



CHAPTER 115

The Pequod Meets The Bachelor.


And jolly enough were the sights and the sounds that came bearing
down before the wind, some few weeks after Ahab's harpoon had been
welded.

It was a Nantucket ship, the Bachelor, which had just wedged in her
last cask of oil, and bolted down her bursting hatches; and now, in
glad holiday apparel, was joyously, though somewhat vain-gloriously,
sailing round among the widely-separated ships on the ground,
previous to pointing her prow for home.

The three men at her mast-head wore long streamers of narrow red
bunting at their hats; from the stern, a whale-boat was suspended,
bottom down; and hanging captive from the bowsprit was seen the long
lower jaw of the last whale they had slain.  Signals, ensigns, and
jacks of all colours were flying from her rigging, on every side.
Sideways lashed in each of her three basketed tops were two barrels
of sperm; above which, in her top-mast cross-trees, you saw slender
breakers of the same precious fluid; and nailed to her main truck was
a brazen lamp.

As was afterwards learned, the Bachelor had met with the most
surprising success; all the more wonderful, for that while cruising
in the same seas numerous other vessels had gone entire months
without securing a single fish.  Not only had barrels of beef and
bread been given away to make room for the far more valuable sperm,
but additional supplemental casks had been bartered for, from the
ships she had met; and these were stowed along the deck, and in the
captain's and officers' state-rooms.  Even the cabin table itself
had been knocked into kindling-wood; and the cabin mess dined off the
broad head of an oil-butt, lashed down to the floor for a
centrepiece.  In the forecastle, the sailors had actually caulked
and pitched their chests, and filled them; it was humorously added,
that the cook had clapped a head on his largest boiler, and filled
it; that the steward had plugged his spare coffee-pot and filled it;
that the harpooneers had headed the sockets of their irons and filled
them; that indeed everything was filled with sperm, except the
captain's pantaloons pockets, and those he reserved to thrust his
hands into, in self-complacent testimony of his entire satisfaction.

As this glad ship of good luck bore down upon the moody Pequod, the
barbarian sound of enormous drums came from her forecastle; and
drawing still nearer, a crowd of her men were seen standing round her
huge try-pots, which, covered with the parchment-like POKE or stomach
skin of the black fish, gave forth a loud roar to every stroke of the
clenched hands of the crew.  On the quarter-deck, the mates and
harpooneers were dancing with the olive-hued girls who had eloped
with them from the Polynesian Isles; while suspended in an
ornamented boat, firmly secured aloft between the foremast and
mainmast, three Long Island negroes, with glittering fiddle-bows of
whale ivory, were presiding over the hilarious jig.  Meanwhile,
others of the ship's company were tumultuously busy at the masonry of
the try-works, from which the huge pots had been removed.  You would
have almost thought they were pulling down the cursed Bastille, such
wild cries they raised, as the now useless brick and mortar were
being hurled into the sea.

Lord and master over all this scene, the captain stood erect on the
ship's elevated quarter-deck, so that the whole rejoicing drama was
full before him, and seemed merely contrived for his own individual
diversion.

And Ahab, he too was standing on his quarter-deck, shaggy and black,
with a stubborn gloom; and as the two ships crossed each other's
wakes--one all jubilations for things passed, the other all
forebodings as to things to come--their two captains in themselves
impersonated the whole striking contrast of the scene.

Come aboard, come aboard! cried the gay Bachelor's commander,
lifting a glass and a bottle in the air.

Hast seen the White Whale? gritted Ahab in reply.

No; only heard of him; but don't believe in him at all, said the
other good-humoredly.  Come aboard!

Thou art too damned jolly.  Sail on.  Hast lost any men?

Not enough to speak of--two islanders, that's all;--but come aboard,"
8018	old hearty, come along.  I'll soon take that black from your brow.
8019	Come along, will ye (merry's the play); a full ship and
8020	"homeward-bound.

How wondrous familiar is a fool! muttered Ahab; then aloud, Thou"
8021	art a full ship and homeward bound, thou sayst; well, then, call me
8022	an empty ship, and outward-bound.  So go thy ways, and I will mine.
8023	"Forward there!  Set all sail, and keep her to the wind!

And thus, while the one ship went cheerily before the breeze, the
other stubbornly fought against it; and so the two vessels parted;
the crew of the Pequod looking with grave, lingering glances towards
the receding Bachelor; but the Bachelor's men never heeding their
gaze for the lively revelry they were in.  And as Ahab, leaning over
the taffrail, eyed the homewardbound craft, he took from his pocket a
small vial of sand, and then looking from the ship to the vial,
seemed thereby bringing two remote associations together, for that
vial was filled with Nantucket soundings.



CHAPTER 116

The Dying Whale.


Not seldom in this life, when, on the right side, fortune's favourites
sail close by us, we, though all adroop before, catch somewhat of the
rushing breeze, and joyfully feel our bagging sails fill out.  So
seemed it with the Pequod.  For next day after encountering the gay
Bachelor, whales were seen and four were slain; and one of them by
Ahab.

It was far down the afternoon; and when all the spearings of the
crimson fight were done: and floating in the lovely sunset sea and
sky, sun and whale both stilly died together; then, such a sweetness
and such plaintiveness, such inwreathing orisons curled up in that
rosy air, that it almost seemed as if far over from the deep green
convent valleys of the Manilla isles, the Spanish land-breeze,
wantonly turned sailor, had gone to sea, freighted with these vesper
hymns.

Soothed again, but only soothed to deeper gloom, Ahab, who had
sterned off from the whale, sat intently watching his final wanings
from the now tranquil boat.  For that strange spectacle observable in
all sperm whales dying--the turning sunwards of the head, and so
expiring--that strange spectacle, beheld of such a placid evening,
somehow to Ahab conveyed a wondrousness unknown before.

He turns and turns him to it,--how slowly, but how steadfastly, his"
8024	homage-rendering and invoking brow, with his last dying motions.  He
8025	too worships fire; most faithful, broad, baronial vassal of the
8026	sun!--Oh that these too-favouring eyes should see these too-favouring
8027	sights.  Look! here, far water-locked; beyond all hum of human weal
8028	or woe; in these most candid and impartial seas; where to traditions
8029	no rocks furnish tablets; where for long Chinese ages, the billows
8030	have still rolled on speechless and unspoken to, as stars that shine
8031	upon the Niger's unknown source; here, too, life dies sunwards full
8032	of faith; but see! no sooner dead, than death whirls round the
8033	corpse, and it heads some other way.
8034	
8035	"Oh, thou dark Hindoo half of nature, who of drowned bones hast
builded thy separate throne somewhere in the heart of these
unverdured seas; thou art an infidel, thou queen, and too truly
speakest to me in the wide-slaughtering Typhoon, and the hushed
burial of its after calm.  Nor has this thy whale sunwards turned his
dying head, and then gone round again, without a lesson to me.

Oh, trebly hooped and welded hip of power!  Oh, high aspiring,"
8036	rainbowed jet!--that one strivest, this one jettest all in vain!  In
8037	vain, oh whale, dost thou seek intercedings with yon all-quickening
8038	sun, that only calls forth life, but gives it not again.  Yet dost
8039	thou, darker half, rock me with a prouder, if a darker faith.  All
8040	thy unnamable imminglings float beneath me here; I am buoyed by
8041	breaths of once living things, exhaled as air, but water now.
8042	
8043	"Then hail, for ever hail, O sea, in whose eternal tossings the wild
fowl finds his only rest.  Born of earth, yet suckled by the sea;
though hill and valley mothered me, ye billows are my
foster-brothers!"

8047	CHAPTER 117
8048	
8049	The Whale Watch.
8050	
8051	
8052	The four whales slain that evening had died wide apart; one, far to
8053	windward; one, less distant, to leeward; one ahead; one astern.
8054	These last three were brought alongside ere nightfall; but the
8055	windward one could not be reached till morning; and the boat that had
8056	killed it lay by its side all night; and that boat was Ahab's.
8057	
8058	The waif-pole was thrust upright into the dead whale's spout-hole;
8059	and the lantern hanging from its top, cast a troubled flickering
8060	glare upon the black, glossy back, and far out upon the midnight
8061	waves, which gently chafed the whale's broad flank, like soft surf
8062	upon a beach.
8063	
8064	Ahab and all his boat's crew seemed asleep but the Parsee; who
8065	crouching in the bow, sat watching the sharks, that spectrally played
8066	round the whale, and tapped the light cedar planks with their tails.
8067	A sound like the moaning in squadrons over Asphaltites of unforgiven
8068	ghosts of Gomorrah, ran shuddering through the air.
8069	
8070	Started from his slumbers, Ahab, face to face, saw the Parsee; and
8071	hooped round by the gloom of the night they seemed the last men in a
8072	flooded world.  I have dreamed it again, said he.
8073	
8074	"Of the hearses?  Have I not said, old man, that neither hearse nor
coffin can be thine?"
8075	
8076	And who are hearsed that die on the sea?
8077	
8078	"But I said, old man, that ere thou couldst die on this voyage, two
hearses must verily be seen by thee on the sea; the first not made by
mortal hands; and the visible wood of the last one must be grown in
America."
8079	
8080	"Aye, aye! a strange sight that, Parsee:--a hearse and its plumes
floating over the ocean with the waves for the pall-bearers.  Ha!
Such a sight we shall not soon see."
8081	
8082	Believe it or not, thou canst not die till it be seen, old man.
8083	
8084	And what was that saying about thyself?
8085	
8086	Though it come to the last, I shall still go before thee thy pilot.
8087	
8088	"And when thou art so gone before--if that ever befall--then ere I
can follow, thou must still appear to me, to pilot me still?--Was it
not so?  Well, then, did I believe all ye say, oh my pilot!  I have
here two pledges that I shall yet slay Moby Dick and survive it."
8089	
8090	Take another pledge, old man, said the Parsee, as his eyes lighted
8091	up like fire-flies in the gloom--Hemp only can kill thee.
8092	
8093	The gallows, ye mean.--I am immortal then, on land and on sea,
8094	cried Ahab, with a laugh of derision;--Immortal on land and on sea!
8095	
8096	Both were silent again, as one man.  The grey dawn came on, and the
8097	slumbering crew arose from the boat's bottom, and ere noon the dead
8098	whale was brought to the ship.
8099	
8100	
8101	
8102	CHAPTER 118
8103	
8104	The Quadrant.
8105	
8106	
8107	The season for the Line at length drew near; and every day when Ahab,
8108	coming from his cabin, cast his eyes aloft, the vigilant helmsman
8109	would ostentatiously handle his spokes, and the eager mariners
8110	quickly run to the braces, and would stand there with all their eyes
8111	centrally fixed on the nailed doubloon; impatient for the order to
8112	point the ship's prow for the equator.  In good time the order came.
8113	It was hard upon high noon; and Ahab, seated in the bows of his
8114	high-hoisted boat, was about taking his wonted daily observation of
8115	the sun to determine his latitude.
8116	
8117	Now, in that Japanese sea, the days in summer are as freshets of
8118	effulgences.  That unblinkingly vivid Japanese sun seems the blazing
8119	focus of the glassy ocean's immeasurable burning-glass.  The sky
8120	looks lacquered; clouds there are none; the horizon floats; and this
8121	nakedness of unrelieved radiance is as the insufferable splendors of
8122	God's throne.  Well that Ahab's quadrant was furnished with coloured
8123	glasses, through which to take sight of that solar fire.  So,
8124	swinging his seated form to the roll of the ship, and with his
8125	astrological-looking instrument placed to his eye, he remained in
8126	that posture for some moments to catch the precise instant when the
8127	sun should gain its precise meridian.  Meantime while his whole
8128	attention was absorbed, the Parsee was kneeling beneath him on the
8129	ship's deck, and with face thrown up like Ahab's, was eyeing the same
8130	sun with him; only the lids of his eyes half hooded their orbs, and
8131	his wild face was subdued to an earthly passionlessness.  At length
8132	the desired observation was taken; and with his pencil upon his ivory
8133	leg, Ahab soon calculated what his latitude must be at that precise
8134	instant.  Then falling into a moment's revery, he again looked up
8135	"towards the sun and murmured to himself: Thou sea-mark! thou high
and mighty Pilot! thou tellest me truly where I AM--but canst thou
cast the least hint where I SHALL be?  Or canst thou tell where some
other thing besides me is this moment living?  Where is Moby Dick?
This instant thou must be eyeing him.  These eyes of mine look into
the very eye that is even now beholding him; aye, and into the eye
that is even now equally beholding the objects on the unknown,
thither side of thee, thou sun!"
8136	
8137	Then gazing at his quadrant, and handling, one after the other, its
8138	numerous cabalistical contrivances, he pondered again, and muttered:
8139	"Foolish toy! babies' plaything of haughty Admirals, and Commodores,
and Captains; the world brags of thee, of thy cunning and might; but
what after all canst thou do, but tell the poor, pitiful point, where
thou thyself happenest to be on this wide planet, and the hand that
holds thee: no! not one jot more!  Thou canst not tell where one drop
of water or one grain of sand will be to-morrow noon; and yet with
thy impotence thou insultest the sun!  Science!  Curse thee, thou
vain toy; and cursed be all the things that cast man's eyes aloft to
that heaven, whose live vividness but scorches him, as these old eyes
are even now scorched with thy light, O sun!  Level by nature to this
earth's horizon are the glances of man's eyes; not shot from the
crown of his head, as if God had meant him to gaze on his firmament.
Curse thee, thou quadrant! dashing it to the deck, no longer will I
guide my earthly way by thee; the level ship's compass, and the level
deadreckoning, by log and by line; THESE shall conduct me, and show
me my place on the sea.  Aye, lighting from the boat to the deck,"
8140	"thus I trample on thee, thou paltry thing that feebly pointest on
high; thus I split and destroy thee!"
8141	
8142	As the frantic old man thus spoke and thus trampled with his live and
8143	dead feet, a sneering triumph that seemed meant for Ahab, and a
8144	fatalistic despair that seemed meant for himself--these passed over
8145	the mute, motionless Parsee's face.  Unobserved he rose and glided
8146	away; while, awestruck by the aspect of their commander, the seamen
8147	clustered together on the forecastle, till Ahab, troubledly pacing
8148	the deck, shouted out--To the braces!  Up helm!--square in!
8149	
8150	In an instant the yards swung round; and as the ship half-wheeled
8151	upon her heel, her three firm-seated graceful masts erectly poised
8152	upon her long, ribbed hull, seemed as the three Horatii pirouetting
8153	on one sufficient steed.
8154	
8155	Standing between the knight-heads, Starbuck watched the Pequod's
8156	tumultuous way, and Ahab's also, as he went lurching along the deck.
8157	
8158	"I have sat before the dense coal fire and watched it all aglow, full
of its tormented flaming life; and I have seen it wane at last, down,
down, to dumbest dust.  Old man of oceans! of all this fiery life of
thine, what will at length remain but one little heap of ashes!"
8159	
8160	"Aye, cried Stubb, but sea-coal ashes--mind ye that, Mr.
Starbuck--sea-coal, not your common charcoal.  Well, well; I heard
Ahab mutter, 'Here some one thrusts these cards into these old hands
of mine; swears that I must play them, and no others.'  And damn me,
Ahab, but thou actest right; live in the game, and die in it!"

8165	
8166	The Candles.
8167	
8168	
8169	Warmest climes but nurse the cruellest fangs: the tiger of Bengal
8170	crouches in spiced groves of ceaseless verdure.  Skies the most
8171	effulgent but basket the deadliest thunders: gorgeous Cuba knows
8172	tornadoes that never swept tame northern lands.  So, too, it is, that
8173	in these resplendent Japanese seas the mariner encounters the direst
8174	of all storms, the Typhoon.  It will sometimes burst from out that
8175	cloudless sky, like an exploding bomb upon a dazed and sleepy town.
8176	
8177	Towards evening of that day, the Pequod was torn of her canvas, and
8178	bare-poled was left to fight a Typhoon which had struck her directly
8179	ahead.  When darkness came on, sky and sea roared and split with the
8180	thunder, and blazed with the lightning, that showed the disabled
8181	masts fluttering here and there with the rags which the first fury of
8182	the tempest had left for its after sport.
8183	
8184	Holding by a shroud, Starbuck was standing on the quarter-deck; at
8185	every flash of the lightning glancing aloft, to see what additional
8186	disaster might have befallen the intricate hamper there; while Stubb
8187	and Flask were directing the men in the higher hoisting and firmer
8188	lashing of the boats.  But all their pains seemed naught.  Though
8189	lifted to the very top of the cranes, the windward quarter boat
8190	(Ahab's) did not escape.  A great rolling sea, dashing high up
8191	against the reeling ship's high teetering side, stove in the boat's
8192	bottom at the stern, and left it again, all dripping through like a
8193	sieve.
8194	
8195	Bad work, bad work!  Mr. Starbuck, said Stubb, regarding the wreck,
8196	"but the sea will have its way.  Stubb, for one, can't fight it.  You
see, Mr. Starbuck, a wave has such a great long start before it
leaps, all round the world it runs, and then comes the spring!  But
as for me, all the start I have to meet it, is just across the deck
here.  But never mind; it's all in fun: so the old song
says;--(SINGS.)"
8197	
8198	Oh! jolly is the gale,
8199	And a joker is the whale,
8200	A' flourishin' his tail,--
8201	Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is the Ocean, oh!
8202	
8203	The scud all a flyin',
8204	That's his flip only foamin';
8205	When he stirs in the spicin',--
8206	Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is the Ocean, oh!
8207	
8208	Thunder splits the ships,
8209	But he only smacks his lips,
8210	A tastin' of this flip,--
8211	Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is the Ocean, oh!
8212	
8213	
8214	"Avast Stubb, cried Starbuck, let the Typhoon sing, and strike his
harp here in our rigging; but if thou art a brave man thou wilt hold
thy peace."
8215	
8216	"But I am not a brave man; never said I was a brave man; I am a
coward; and I sing to keep up my spirits.  And I tell you what it is,
Mr. Starbuck, there's no way to stop my singing in this world but to
cut my throat.  And when that's done, ten to one I sing ye the
doxology for a wind-up."
8217	
8218	Madman! look through my eyes if thou hast none of thine own.
8219	
8220	"What! how can you see better of a dark night than anybody else,
never mind how foolish?"
8221	
8222	Here! cried Starbuck, seizing Stubb by the shoulder, and pointing
8223	"his hand towards the weather bow, markest thou not that the gale
comes from the eastward, the very course Ahab is to run for Moby
Dick? the very course he swung to this day noon? now mark his boat
there; where is that stove?  In the stern-sheets, man; where he is
wont to stand--his stand-point is stove, man!  Now jump overboard,
and sing away, if thou must!

I don't half understand ye: what's in the wind?

Yes, yes, round the Cape of Good Hope is the shortest way to"
8224	"Nantucket, soliloquized Starbuck suddenly, heedless of Stubb's
question.  The gale that now hammers at us to stave us, we can turn"
8225	it into a fair wind that will drive us towards home.  Yonder, to
8226	windward, all is blackness of doom; but to leeward, homeward--I see
8227	"it lightens up there; but not with the lightning.

At that moment in one of the intervals of profound darkness,
following the flashes, a voice was heard at his side; and almost at
the same instant a volley of thunder peals rolled overhead.

Who's there?

Old Thunder! said Ahab, groping his way along the bulwarks to his
pivot-hole; but suddenly finding his path made plain to him by
elbowed lances of fire.

Now, as the lightning rod to a spire on shore is intended to carry
off the perilous fluid into the soil; so the kindred rod which at sea
some ships carry to each mast, is intended to conduct it into the
water.  But as this conductor must descend to considerable depth,
that its end may avoid all contact with the hull; and as moreover, if
kept constantly towing there, it would be liable to many mishaps,
besides interfering not a little with some of the rigging, and more
or less impeding the vessel's way in the water; because of all this,
the lower parts of a ship's lightning-rods are not always overboard;
but are generally made in long slender links, so as to be the more
readily hauled up into the chains outside, or thrown down into the
sea, as occasion may require.

The rods! the rods! cried Starbuck to the crew, suddenly admonished
to vigilance by the vivid lightning that had just been darting
flambeaux, to light Ahab to his post.  Are they overboard? drop them"
8228	"over, fore and aft.  Quick!

Avast! cried Ahab; let's have fair play here, though we be the"
8229	weaker side.  Yet I'll contribute to raise rods on the Himmalehs and
8230	Andes, that all the world may be secured; but out on privileges!  Let
8231	"them be, sir.

Look aloft! cried Starbuck.  The corpusants! the corpusants!"
8232	
8233	All the yard-arms were tipped with a pallid fire; and touched at each
8234	tri-pointed lightning-rod-end with three tapering white flames, each
8235	of the three tall masts was silently burning in that sulphurous air,
8236	like three gigantic wax tapers before an altar.
8237	
8238	Blast the boat! let it go! cried Stubb at this instant, as a
8239	swashing sea heaved up under his own little craft, so that its
8240	gunwale violently jammed his hand, as he was passing a lashing.
8241	Blast it!--but slipping backward on the deck, his uplifted eyes
8242	"caught the flames; and immediately shifting his tone he cried--The
corpusants have mercy on us all!"
8243	
8244	To sailors, oaths are household words; they will swear in the trance
8245	of the calm, and in the teeth of the tempest; they will imprecate
8246	curses from the topsail-yard-arms, when most they teeter over to a
8247	seething sea; but in all my voyagings, seldom have I heard a common
8248	oath when God's burning finger has been laid on the ship; when His
8249	Mene, Mene, Tekel Upharsin has been woven into the shrouds and the
8250	cordage.
8251	
8252	While this pallidness was burning aloft, few words were heard from
8253	the enchanted crew; who in one thick cluster stood on the forecastle,
8254	all their eyes gleaming in that pale phosphorescence, like a far away
8255	constellation of stars.  Relieved against the ghostly light, the
8256	gigantic jet negro, Daggoo, loomed up to thrice his real stature, and
8257	seemed the black cloud from which the thunder had come.  The parted
8258	mouth of Tashtego revealed his shark-white teeth, which strangely
8259	gleamed as if they too had been tipped by corpusants; while lit up by
8260	the preternatural light, Queequeg's tattooing burned like Satanic
8261	blue flames on his body.
8262	
8263	The tableau all waned at last with the pallidness aloft; and once
8264	more the Pequod and every soul on her decks were wrapped in a pall.
8265	A moment or two passed, when Starbuck, going forward, pushed against
8266	"some one.  It was Stubb.  What thinkest thou now, man; I heard thy
cry; it was not the same in the song."
8267	
8268	"No, no, it wasn't; I said the corpusants have mercy on us all; and I
hope they will, still.  But do they only have mercy on long
faces?--have they no bowels for a laugh?  And look ye, Mr.
Starbuck--but it's too dark to look.  Hear me, then: I take that
mast-head flame we saw for a sign of good luck; for those masts are
rooted in a hold that is going to be chock a' block with sperm-oil,
d'ye see; and so, all that sperm will work up into the masts, like
sap in a tree.  Yes, our three masts will yet be as three spermaceti
candles--that's the good promise we saw."
8269	
8270	At that moment Starbuck caught sight of Stubb's face slowly beginning
8271	to glimmer into sight.  Glancing upwards, he cried: See! see! and
8272	once more the high tapering flames were beheld with what seemed
8273	redoubled supernaturalness in their pallor.
8274	
8275	The corpusants have mercy on us all, cried Stubb, again.
8276	
8277	At the base of the mainmast, full beneath the doubloon and the
8278	flame, the Parsee was kneeling in Ahab's front, but with his head
8279	bowed away from him; while near by, from the arched and overhanging
8280	rigging, where they had just been engaged securing a spar, a number
8281	of the seamen, arrested by the glare, now cohered together, and hung
8282	pendulous, like a knot of numbed wasps from a drooping, orchard twig.
8283	In various enchanted attitudes, like the standing, or stepping, or
8284	running skeletons in Herculaneum, others remained rooted to the deck;
8285	but all their eyes upcast.
8286	
8287	"Aye, aye, men! cried Ahab.  Look up at it; mark it well; the white
flame but lights the way to the White Whale!  Hand me those mainmast
links there; I would fain feel this pulse, and let mine beat against
it; blood against fire!  So."
8288	
8289	Then turning--the last link held fast in his left hand, he put his
8290	foot upon the Parsee; and with fixed upward eye, and high-flung right
8291	arm, he stood erect before the lofty tri-pointed trinity of flames.
8292	
8293	"Oh! thou clear spirit of clear fire, whom on these seas I as Persian
once did worship, till in the sacramental act so burned by thee, that
to this hour I bear the scar; I now know thee, thou clear spirit, and
I now know that thy right worship is defiance.  To neither love nor
reverence wilt thou be kind; and e'en for hate thou canst but kill;
and all are killed.  No fearless fool now fronts thee.  I own thy
speechless, placeless power; but to the last gasp of my earthquake
life will dispute its unconditional, unintegral mastery in me.  In the
midst of the personified impersonal, a personality stands here.
Though but a point at best; whencesoe'er I came; wheresoe'er I go;
yet while I earthly live, the queenly personality lives in me, and
feels her royal rights.  But war is pain, and hate is woe.  Come in
thy lowest form of love, and I will kneel and kiss thee; but at thy
highest, come as mere supernal power; and though thou launchest
navies of full-freighted worlds, there's that in here that still
remains indifferent.  Oh, thou clear spirit, of thy fire thou madest
me, and like a true child of fire, I breathe it back to thee."
8294	
8295	[SUDDEN, REPEATED FLASHES OF LIGHTNING; THE NINE FLAMES LEAP
8296	LENGTHWISE TO THRICE THEIR PREVIOUS HEIGHT; AHAB, WITH THE REST,
8297	CLOSES HIS EYES, HIS RIGHT HAND PRESSED HARD UPON THEM.]
8298	
8299	"I own thy speechless, placeless power; said I not so?  Nor was it
wrung from me; nor do I now drop these links.  Thou canst blind; but
I can then grope.  Thou canst consume; but I can then be ashes.  Take
the homage of these poor eyes, and shutter-hands.  I would not take
it.  The lightning flashes through my skull; mine eye-balls ache and
ache; my whole beaten brain seems as beheaded, and rolling on some
stunning ground.  Oh, oh!  Yet blindfold, yet will I talk to thee.
Light though thou be, thou leapest out of darkness; but I am darkness
leaping out of light, leaping out of thee!  The javelins cease; open
eyes; see, or not?  There burn the flames!  Oh, thou magnanimous! now
I do glory in my genealogy.  But thou art but my fiery father; my
sweet mother, I know not.  Oh, cruel! what hast thou done with her?
There lies my puzzle; but thine is greater.  Thou knowest not how
came ye, hence callest thyself unbegotten; certainly knowest not thy
beginning, hence callest thyself unbegun.  I know that of me, which
thou knowest not of thyself, oh, thou omnipotent.  There is some
unsuffusing thing beyond thee, thou clear spirit, to whom all thy
eternity is but time, all thy creativeness mechanical.  Through thee,
thy flaming self, my scorched eyes do dimly see it.  Oh, thou
foundling fire, thou hermit immemorial, thou too hast thy
incommunicable riddle, thy unparticipated grief.  Here again with
haughty agony, I read my sire.  Leap! leap up, and lick the sky!  I
leap with thee; I burn with thee; would fain be welded with thee;
defyingly I worship thee!"
8300	
8301	The boat! the boat! cried Starbuck, look at thy boat, old man!
8302	
8303	Ahab's harpoon, the one forged at Perth's fire, remained firmly
8304	lashed in its conspicuous crotch, so that it projected beyond his
8305	whale-boat's bow; but the sea that had stove its bottom had caused
8306	the loose leather sheath to drop off; and from the keen steel barb
8307	there now came a levelled flame of pale, forked fire.  As the silent
8308	harpoon burned there like a serpent's tongue, Starbuck grasped Ahab
8309	"by the arm--God, God is against thee, old man; forbear! 'tis an
ill voyage! ill begun, ill continued; let me square the yards, while
we may, old man, and make a fair wind of it homewards, to go on a
better voyage than this."
8310	
8311	Overhearing Starbuck, the panic-stricken crew instantly ran to the
8312	braces--though not a sail was left aloft.  For the moment all the
8313	aghast mate's thoughts seemed theirs; they raised a half mutinous
8314	cry.  But dashing the rattling lightning links to the deck, and
8315	snatching the burning harpoon, Ahab waved it like a torch among them;
8316	swearing to transfix with it the first sailor that but cast loose a
8317	rope's end.  Petrified by his aspect, and still more shrinking from
8318	the fiery dart that he held, the men fell back in dismay, and Ahab
8319	again spoke:--
8320	
8321	"All your oaths to hunt the White Whale are as binding as mine; and
heart, soul, and body, lungs and life, old Ahab is bound.  And that
ye may know to what tune this heart beats; look ye here; thus I blow
out the last fear!  And with one blast of his breath he extinguished"
8322	the flame.
8323	
8324	As in the hurricane that sweeps the plain, men fly the neighborhood
8325	of some lone, gigantic elm, whose very height and strength but render
8326	it so much the more unsafe, because so much the more a mark for
8327	thunderbolts; so at those last words of Ahab's many of the mariners
8328	did run from him in a terror of dismay.

8339	We must send down the main-top-sail yard, sir.  The band is working

Strike nothing; lash it.  If I had sky-sail poles, I'd sway them up"
8341	"now.

Sir!--in God's name!--sir?

Well.

The anchors are working, sir.  Shall I get them inboard?

Strike nothing, and stir nothing, but lash everything.  The wind"
8342	rises, but it has not got up to my table-lands yet.  Quick, and see
8343	to it.--By masts and keels! he takes me for the hunch-backed skipper
8344	of some coasting smack.  Send down my main-top-sail yard!  Ho,
8345	gluepots!  Loftiest trucks were made for wildest winds, and this
8346	brain-truck of mine now sails amid the cloud-scud.  Shall I strike
8347	that?  Oh, none but cowards send down their brain-trucks in tempest
8348	time.  What a hooroosh aloft there!  I would e'en take it for
8349	sublime, did I not know that the colic is a noisy malady.  Oh, take
8350	"medicine, take medicine!

Midnight.--The Forecastle Bulwarks.


STUBB AND FLASK MOUNTED ON THEM, AND PASSING ADDITIONAL LASHINGS OVER
THE ANCHORS THERE HANGING.


No, Stubb; you may pound that knot there as much as you please, but
you will never pound into me what you were just now saying.  And how
long ago is it since you said the very contrary?  Didn't you once say
that whatever ship Ahab sails in, that ship should pay something
extra on its insurance policy, just as though it were loaded with
powder barrels aft and boxes of lucifers forward?  Stop, now; didn't
you say so?"
8351	
8352	"Well, suppose I did?  What then?  I've part changed my flesh since
that time, why not my mind?  Besides, supposing we ARE loaded with
powder barrels aft and lucifers forward; how the devil could the
lucifers get afire in this drenching spray here?  Why, my little man,
you have pretty red hair, but you couldn't get afire now.  Shake
yourself; you're Aquarius, or the water-bearer, Flask; might fill
pitchers at your coat collar.  Don't you see, then, that for these
extra risks the Marine Insurance companies have extra guarantees?
Here are hydrants, Flask.  But hark, again, and I'll answer ye the
other thing.  First take your leg off from the crown of the anchor
here, though, so I can pass the rope; now listen.  What's the mighty
difference between holding a mast's lightning-rod in the storm, and
standing close by a mast that hasn't got any lightning-rod at all in
a storm?  Don't you see, you timber-head, that no harm can come to
the holder of the rod, unless the mast is first struck?  What are you
talking about, then?  Not one ship in a hundred carries rods, and
Ahab,--aye, man, and all of us,--were in no more danger then, in my
poor opinion, than all the crews in ten thousand ships now sailing
the seas.  Why, you King-Post, you, I suppose you would have every
man in the world go about with a small lightning-rod running up the
corner of his hat, like a militia officer's skewered feather, and
trailing behind like his sash.  Why don't ye be sensible, Flask? it's
easy to be sensible; why don't ye, then? any man with half an eye can
be sensible."
8353	
8354	I don't know that, Stubb.  You sometimes find it rather hard.
8355	
8356	"Yes, when a fellow's soaked through, it's hard to be sensible,
that's a fact.  And I am about drenched with this spray.  Never mind;
catch the turn there, and pass it.  Seems to me we are lashing down
these anchors now as if they were never going to be used again.
Tying these two anchors here, Flask, seems like tying a man's hands
behind him.  And what big generous hands they are, to be sure.  These
are your iron fists, hey?  What a hold they have, too!  I wonder,
Flask, whether the world is anchored anywhere; if she is, she swings
with an uncommon long cable, though.  There, hammer that knot down,
and we've done.  So; next to touching land, lighting on deck is the
most satisfactory.  I say, just wring out my jacket skirts, will ye?
Thank ye.  They laugh at long-togs so, Flask; but seems to me, a
Long tailed coat ought always to be worn in all storms afloat.  The
tails tapering down that way, serve to carry off the water, d'ye see.
Same with cocked hats; the cocks form gable-end eave-troughs, Flask.
No more monkey-jackets and tarpaulins for me; I must mount a
swallow-tail, and drive down a beaver; so.  Halloa! whew! there goes
my tarpaulin overboard; Lord, Lord, that the winds that come from
heaven should be so unmannerly!  This is a nasty night, lad."

8373	
8374	The Musket.
8375	
8376	
8377	During the most violent shocks of the Typhoon, the man at the
8378	Pequod's jaw-bone tiller had several times been reelingly hurled to
8379	the deck by its spasmodic motions, even though preventer tackles had
8380	been attached to it--for they were slack--because some play to the
8381	tiller was indispensable.
8382	
8383	In a severe gale like this, while the ship is but a tossed
8384	shuttlecock to the blast, it is by no means uncommon to see the
8385	needles in the compasses, at intervals, go round and round.  It was
8386	thus with the Pequod's; at almost every shock the helmsman had not
8387	failed to notice the whirling velocity with which they revolved upon
8388	the cards; it is a sight that hardly anyone can behold without some
8389	sort of unwonted emotion.
8390	
8391	Some hours after midnight, the Typhoon abated so much, that through
8392	the strenuous exertions of Starbuck and Stubb--one engaged forward
8393	and the other aft--the shivered remnants of the jib and fore and
8394	main-top-sails were cut adrift from the spars, and went eddying away
8395	to leeward, like the feathers of an albatross, which sometimes are
8396	cast to the winds when that storm-tossed bird is on the wing.
8397	
8398	The three corresponding new sails were now bent and reefed, and a
8399	storm-trysail was set further aft; so that the ship soon went through
8400	the water with some precision again; and the course--for the present,
8401	East-south-east--which he was to steer, if practicable, was once more
8402	given to the helmsman.  For during the violence of the gale, he had
8403	only steered according to its vicissitudes.  But as he was now
8404	bringing the ship as near her course as possible, watching the
8405	compass meanwhile, lo! a good sign! the wind seemed coming round
8406	astern; aye, the foul breeze became fair!
8407	
8408	"Instantly the yards were squared, to the lively song of HO! THE FAIR
WIND! OH-YE-HO, CHEERLY MEN! the crew singing for joy, that so"
8409	promising an event should so soon have falsified the evil portents
8410	preceding it.
8411	
8412	In compliance with the standing order of his commander--to report
8413	immediately, and at any one of the twenty-four hours, any decided
8414	change in the affairs of the deck,--Starbuck had no sooner trimmed
8415	the yards to the breeze--however reluctantly and gloomily,--than he
8416	mechanically went below to apprise Captain Ahab of the circumstance.
8417	
8418	Ere knocking at his state-room, he involuntarily paused before it a
8419	moment.  The cabin lamp--taking long swings this way and that--was
8420	burning fitfully, and casting fitful shadows upon the old man's
8421	bolted door,--a thin one, with fixed blinds inserted, in place of
8422	upper panels.  The isolated subterraneousness of the cabin made a
8423	certain humming silence to reign there, though it was hooped round by
8424	all the roar of the elements.  The loaded muskets in the rack were
8425	shiningly revealed, as they stood upright against the forward
8426	bulkhead.  Starbuck was an honest, upright man; but out of Starbuck's
8427	heart, at that instant when he saw the muskets, there strangely
8428	evolved an evil thought; but so blent with its neutral or good
8429	accompaniments that for the instant he hardly knew it for itself.
8430	
8431	"He would have shot me once, he murmured, yes, there's the very
musket that he pointed at me;--that one with the studded stock; let
me touch it--lift it.  Strange, that I, who have handled so many
deadly lances, strange, that I should shake so now.  Loaded?  I must
see.  Aye, aye; and powder in the pan;--that's not good.  Best spill
it?--wait.  I'll cure myself of this.  I'll hold the musket boldly
while I think.--I come to report a fair wind to him.  But how fair?
Fair for death and doom,--THAT'S fair for Moby Dick.  It's a fair
wind that's only fair for that accursed fish.--The very tube he
pointed at me!--the very one; THIS one--I hold it here; he would have
killed me with the very thing I handle now.--Aye and he would fain
kill all his crew.  Does he not say he will not strike his spars to
any gale?  Has he not dashed his heavenly quadrant? and in these same
perilous seas, gropes he not his way by mere dead reckoning of the
error-abounding log? and in this very Typhoon, did he not swear that
he would have no lightning-rods?  But shall this crazed old man be
tamely suffered to drag a whole ship's company down to doom with
him?--Yes, it would make him the wilful murderer of thirty men and
more, if this ship come to any deadly harm; and come to deadly harm,
my soul swears this ship will, if Ahab have his way.  If, then, he
were this instant--put aside, that crime would not be his.  Ha! is he
muttering in his sleep?  Yes, just there,--in there, he's sleeping.
Sleeping? aye, but still alive, and soon awake again.  I can't
withstand thee, then, old man.  Not reasoning; not remonstrance; not
entreaty wilt thou hearken to; all this thou scornest.  Flat
obedience to thy own flat commands, this is all thou breathest.  Aye,
and say'st the men have vow'd thy vow; say'st all of us are Ahabs.
Great God forbid!--But is there no other way? no lawful way?--Make
him a prisoner to be taken home?  What! hope to wrest this old man's
living power from his own living hands?  Only a fool would try it.
Say he were pinioned even; knotted all over with ropes and hawsers;
chained down to ring-bolts on this cabin floor; he would be more
hideous than a caged tiger, then.  I could not endure the sight;
could not possibly fly his howlings; all comfort, sleep itself,
inestimable reason would leave me on the long intolerable voyage.
What, then, remains?  The land is hundreds of leagues away, and
locked Japan the nearest.  I stand alone here upon an open sea, with
two oceans and a whole continent between me and law.--Aye, aye, 'tis
so.--Is heaven a murderer when its lightning strikes a would-be
murderer in his bed, tindering sheets and skin together?--And would I
be a murderer, then, if--and slowly, stealthily, and half sideways"
8432	looking, he placed the loaded musket's end against the door.
8433	
8434	"On this level, Ahab's hammock swings within; his head this way.  A
touch, and Starbuck may survive to hug his wife and child again.--Oh
Mary!  Mary!--boy! boy! boy!--But if I wake thee not to death, old
man, who can tell to what unsounded deeps Starbuck's body this day
week may sink, with all the crew!  Great God, where art Thou?  Shall
I? shall I?--The wind has gone down and shifted, sir; the fore and
main topsails are reefed and set; she heads her course."
8435	
8436	Stern all!  Oh Moby Dick, I clutch thy heart at last!
8437	
8438	Such were the sounds that now came hurtling from out the old man's
8439	tormented sleep, as if Starbuck's voice had caused the long dumb
8440	dream to speak.
8441	
8442	The yet levelled musket shook like a drunkard's arm against the
8443	panel; Starbuck seemed wrestling with an angel; but turning from the
8444	door, he placed the death-tube in its rack, and left the place.
8445	
8446	"He's too sound asleep, Mr. Stubb; go thou down, and wake him, and
tell him.  I must see to the deck here.  Thou know'st what to say."

8449	
8450	CHAPTER 124
8451	
8452	The Needle.
8453	
8454	
8455	Next morning the not-yet-subsided sea rolled in long slow billows of
8456	mighty bulk, and striving in the Pequod's gurgling track, pushed her
8457	on like giants' palms outspread.  The strong, unstaggering breeze
8458	abounded so, that sky and air seemed vast outbellying sails; the
8459	whole world boomed before the wind.  Muffled in the full morning
8460	light, the invisible sun was only known by the spread intensity of
8461	his place; where his bayonet rays moved on in stacks.  Emblazonings,
8462	as of crowned Babylonian kings and queens, reigned over everything.
8463	The sea was as a crucible of molten gold, that bubblingly leaps with
8464	light and heat.
8465	
8466	Long maintaining an enchanted silence, Ahab stood apart; and every
8467	time the tetering ship loweringly pitched down her bowsprit, he
8468	turned to eye the bright sun's rays produced ahead; and when she
8469	profoundly settled by the stern, he turned behind, and saw the sun's
8470	rearward place, and how the same yellow rays were blending with his
8471	undeviating wake.
8472	
8473	"Ha, ha, my ship! thou mightest well be taken now for the sea-chariot
of the sun.  Ho, ho! all ye nations before my prow, I bring the sun
to ye!  Yoke on the further billows; hallo! a tandem, I drive the
sea!"
8474	
8475	But suddenly reined back by some counter thought, he hurried towards
8476	the helm, huskily demanding how the ship was heading.
8477	
8478	East-sou-east, sir, said the frightened steersman.
8479	
8480	"Thou liest! smiting him with his clenched fist.  Heading East at
this hour in the morning, and the sun astern?"
8481	
8482	Upon this every soul was confounded; for the phenomenon just then
8483	observed by Ahab had unaccountably escaped every one else; but its
8484	very blinding palpableness must have been the cause.
8485	
8486	Thrusting his head half way into the binnacle, Ahab caught one
8487	glimpse of the compasses; his uplifted arm slowly fell; for a moment
8488	he almost seemed to stagger.  Standing behind him Starbuck looked,
8489	and lo! the two compasses pointed East, and the Pequod was as
8490	infallibly going West.
8491	
8492	But ere the first wild alarm could get out abroad among the crew, the
8493	"old man with a rigid laugh exclaimed, I have it!  It has happened
before.  Mr. Starbuck, last night's thunder turned our
compasses--that's all.  Thou hast before now heard of such a thing, I
take it."
8494	
8495	Aye; but never before has it happened to me, sir, said the pale
8496	mate, gloomily.
8497	
8498	Here, it must needs be said, that accidents like this have in more
8499	than one case occurred to ships in violent storms.  The magnetic
8500	energy, as developed in the mariner's needle, is, as all know,
8501	essentially one with the electricity beheld in heaven; hence it is
8502	not to be much marvelled at, that such things should be.  Instances
8503	where the lightning has actually struck the vessel, so as to smite
8504	down some of the spars and rigging, the effect upon the needle has at
8505	times been still more fatal; all its loadstone virtue being
8506	annihilated, so that the before magnetic steel was of no more use
8507	than an old wife's knitting needle.  But in either case, the needle
8508	never again, of itself, recovers the original virtue thus marred or
8509	lost; and if the binnacle compasses be affected, the same fate
8510	reaches all the others that may be in the ship; even were the
8511	lowermost one inserted into the kelson.
8512	
8513	Deliberately standing before the binnacle, and eyeing the
8514	transpointed compasses, the old man, with the sharp of his extended
8515	hand, now took the precise bearing of the sun, and satisfied that the
8516	needles were exactly inverted, shouted out his orders for the ship's
8517	course to be changed accordingly.  The yards were hard up; and once
8518	more the Pequod thrust her undaunted bows into the opposing wind, for
8519	the supposed fair one had only been juggling her.
8520	
8521	Meanwhile, whatever were his own secret thoughts, Starbuck said
8522	nothing, but quietly he issued all requisite orders; while Stubb and
8523	Flask--who in some small degree seemed then to be sharing his
8524	feelings--likewise unmurmuringly acquiesced.  As for the men, though
8525	some of them lowly rumbled, their fear of Ahab was greater than their
8526	fear of Fate.  But as ever before, the pagan harpooneers remained
8527	almost wholly unimpressed; or if impressed, it was only with a
8528	certain magnetism shot into their congenial hearts from inflexible
8529	Ahab's.
8530	
8531	For a space the old man walked the deck in rolling reveries.  But
8532	chancing to slip with his ivory heel, he saw the crushed copper
8533	sight-tubes of the quadrant he had the day before dashed to the deck.
8534	
8535	"Thou poor, proud heaven-gazer and sun's pilot! yesterday I wrecked
thee, and to-day the compasses would fain have wrecked me.  So, so.
But Ahab is lord over the level loadstone yet.  Mr. Starbuck--a lance
without a pole; a top-maul, and the smallest of the sail-maker's
needles.  Quick!"
8536	
8537	Accessory, perhaps, to the impulse dictating the thing he was now
8538	about to do, were certain prudential motives, whose object might have
8539	been to revive the spirits of his crew by a stroke of his subtile
8540	skill, in a matter so wondrous as that of the inverted compasses.
8541	Besides, the old man well knew that to steer by transpointed needles,
8542	though clumsily practicable, was not a thing to be passed over by
8543	superstitious sailors, without some shudderings and evil portents.
8544	
8545	Men, said he, steadily turning upon the crew, as the mate handed
8546	"him the things he had demanded, my men, the thunder turned old
Ahab's needles; but out of this bit of steel Ahab can make one of his
own, that will point as true as any."
8547	
8548	Abashed glances of servile wonder were exchanged by the sailors, as
8549	this was said; and with fascinated eyes they awaited whatever magic
8550	might follow.  But Starbuck looked away.
8551	
8552	With a blow from the top-maul Ahab knocked off the steel head of the
8553	lance, and then handing to the mate the long iron rod remaining, bade
8554	him hold it upright, without its touching the deck.  Then, with the
8555	maul, after repeatedly smiting the upper end of this iron rod, he
8556	placed the blunted needle endwise on the top of it, and less strongly
8557	hammered that, several times, the mate still holding the rod as
8558	before.  Then going through some small strange motions with
8559	it--whether indispensable to the magnetizing of the steel, or merely
8560	intended to augment the awe of the crew, is uncertain--he called for
8561	linen thread; and moving to the binnacle, slipped out the two
8562	reversed needles there, and horizontally suspended the sail-needle by
8563	its middle, over one of the compass-cards.  At first, the steel went
8564	round and round, quivering and vibrating at either end; but at last
8565	it settled to its place, when Ahab, who had been intently watching
8566	for this result, stepped frankly back from the binnacle, and pointing
8567	"his stretched arm towards it, exclaimed,--Look ye, for yourselves,
if Ahab be not lord of the level loadstone!  The sun is East, and
that compass swears it!"
8568	
8569	One after another they peered in, for nothing but their own eyes
8570	could persuade such ignorance as theirs, and one after another they
8571	slunk away.
8572	
8573	In his fiery eyes of scorn and triumph, you then saw Ahab in all his
8574	fatal pride.
8575

8578	CHAPTER 125
8579	
8580	The Log and Line.
8581	
8582	
8583	While now the fated Pequod had been so long afloat this voyage, the
8584	log and line had but very seldom been in use.  Owing to a confident
8585	reliance upon other means of determining the vessel's place, some
8586	merchantmen, and many whalemen, especially when cruising, wholly
8587	neglect to heave the log; though at the same time, and frequently
8588	more for form's sake than anything else, regularly putting down upon
8589	the customary slate the course steered by the ship, as well as the
8590	presumed average rate of progression every hour.  It had been thus
8591	with the Pequod.  The wooden reel and angular log attached hung, long
8592	untouched, just beneath the railing of the after bulwarks.  Rains and
8593	spray had damped it; sun and wind had warped it; all the elements
8594	had combined to rot a thing that hung so idly.  But heedless of all
8595	this, his mood seized Ahab, as he happened to glance upon the reel,
8596	not many hours after the magnet scene, and he remembered how his
8597	quadrant was no more, and recalled his frantic oath about the level
8598	log and line.  The ship was sailing plungingly; astern the billows
8599	rolled in riots.
8600	
8601	Forward, there!  Heave the log!
8602	
8603	Two seamen came.  The golden-hued Tahitian and the grizzly Manxman.
8604	Take the reel, one of ye, I'll heave.
8605	
8606	They went towards the extreme stern, on the ship's lee side, where
8607	the deck, with the oblique energy of the wind, was now almost dipping
8608	into the creamy, sidelong-rushing sea.
8609	
8610	The Manxman took the reel, and holding it high up, by the projecting
8611	handle-ends of the spindle, round which the spool of line revolved,
8612	so stood with the angular log hanging downwards, till Ahab advanced
8613	to him.
8614	
8615	Ahab stood before him, and was lightly unwinding some thirty or forty
8616	turns to form a preliminary hand-coil to toss overboard, when the old
8617	Manxman, who was intently eyeing both him and the line, made bold to
8618	speak.
8619	
8620	"Sir, I mistrust it; this line looks far gone, long heat and wet have
spoiled it."
8621	
8622	"'Twill hold, old gentleman.  Long heat and wet, have they spoiled
thee?  Thou seem'st to hold.  Or, truer perhaps, life holds thee;
not thou it."
8623	
8624	"I hold the spool, sir.  But just as my captain says.  With these
grey hairs of mine 'tis not worth while disputing, 'specially with a
superior, who'll ne'er confess."
8625	
8626	"What's that?  There now's a patched professor in Queen Nature's
granite-founded College; but methinks he's too subservient.  Where
wert thou born?"
8627	
8628	In the little rocky Isle of Man, sir.
8629	
8630	Excellent!  Thou'st hit the world by that.
8631	
8632	I know not, sir, but I was born there.
8633	
8634	"In the Isle of Man, hey?  Well, the other way, it's good.  Here's a
man from Man; a man born in once independent Man, and now unmanned of
Man; which is sucked in--by what?  Up with the reel!  The dead, blind
wall butts all inquiring heads at last.  Up with it!  So."
8635	
8636	The log was heaved.  The loose coils rapidly straightened out in a
8637	long dragging line astern, and then, instantly, the reel began to
8638	whirl.  In turn, jerkingly raised and lowered by the rolling billows,
8639	the towing resistance of the log caused the old reelman to stagger
8640	strangely.
8641	
8642	Hold hard!
8643	
8644	Snap! the overstrained line sagged down in one long festoon; the
8645	tugging log was gone.
8646	
8647	"I crush the quadrant, the thunder turns the needles, and now the mad
sea parts the log-line.  But Ahab can mend all.  Haul in here,
Tahitian; reel up, Manxman.  And look ye, let the carpenter make
another log, and mend thou the line.  See to it."
8648	
8649	"There he goes now; to him nothing's happened; but to me, the skewer
seems loosening out of the middle of the world.  Haul in, haul in,
Tahitian!  These lines run whole, and whirling out: come in broken,
and dragging slow.  Ha, Pip? come to help; eh, Pip?"
8650	
8651	"Pip? whom call ye Pip?  Pip jumped from the whale-boat.  Pip's
missing.  Let's see now if ye haven't fished him up here, fisherman.
It drags hard; I guess he's holding on.  Jerk him, Tahiti!  Jerk him
off; we haul in no cowards here.  Ho! there's his arm just breaking
water.  A hatchet! a hatchet! cut it off--we haul in no cowards here.
Captain Ahab! sir, sir! here's Pip, trying to get on board again."
8652	
8653	Peace, thou crazy loon, cried the Manxman, seizing him by the arm.
8654	Away from the quarter-deck!
8655	
8656	The greater idiot ever scolds the lesser, muttered Ahab, advancing.
8657	"Hands off from that holiness!  Where sayest thou Pip was, boy?

Astern there, sir, astern!  Lo! lo!

And who art thou, boy?  I see not my reflection in the vacant pupils"
8658	of thy eyes.  Oh God! that man should be a thing for immortal souls
8659	"to sieve through!  Who art thou, boy?

Bell-boy, sir; ship's-crier; ding, dong, ding!  Pip!  Pip!  Pip!  One"
8660	hundred pounds of clay reward for Pip; five feet high--looks
8661	cowardly--quickest known by that!  Ding, dong, ding!  Who's seen Pip
8662	"the coward?

There can be no hearts above the snow-line.  Oh, ye frozen heavens!"
8663	look down here.  Ye did beget this luckless child, and have abandoned
8664	him, ye creative libertines.  Here, boy; Ahab's cabin shall be Pip's
8665	home henceforth, while Ahab lives.  Thou touchest my inmost centre,
8666	boy; thou art tied to me by cords woven of my heart-strings.  Come,
8667	"let's down.

What's this? here's velvet shark-skin, intently gazing at Ahab's
hand, and feeling it.  Ah, now, had poor Pip but felt so kind a"
8668	thing as this, perhaps he had ne'er been lost!  This seems to me,
8669	sir, as a man-rope; something that weak souls may hold by.  Oh, sir,
8670	let old Perth now come and rivet these two hands together; the black
8671	"one with the white, for I will not let this go.

Oh, boy, nor will I thee, unless I should thereby drag thee to worse"
8672	horrors than are here.  Come, then, to my cabin.  Lo! ye believers in
8673	gods all goodness, and in man all ill, lo you! see the omniscient
8674	gods oblivious of suffering man; and man, though idiotic, and knowing
8675	not what he does, yet full of the sweet things of love and gratitude.
8676	Come!  I feel prouder leading thee by thy black hand, than though I
8677	"grasped an Emperor's!

There go two daft ones now, muttered the old Manxman.  One daft"
8678	with strength, the other daft with weakness.  But here's the end of
8679	the rotten line--all dripping, too.  Mend it, eh?  I think we had
8680	"best have a new line altogether.  I'll see Mr. Stubb about it.



CHAPTER 126

The Life-Buoy.


Steering now south-eastward by Ahab's levelled steel, and her
progress solely determined by Ahab's level log and line; the Pequod
held on her path towards the Equator.  Making so long a passage
through such unfrequented waters, descrying no ships, and ere long,
sideways impelled by unvarying trade winds, over waves monotonously
mild; all these seemed the strange calm things preluding some riotous
and desperate scene.

At last, when the ship drew near to the outskirts, as it were, of the
Equatorial fishing-ground, and in the deep darkness that goes before
the dawn, was sailing by a cluster of rocky islets; the watch--then
headed by Flask--was startled by a cry so plaintively wild and
unearthly--like half-articulated wailings of the ghosts of all
Herod's murdered Innocents--that one and all, they started from their
reveries, and for the space of some moments stood, or sat, or leaned
all transfixedly listening, like the carved Roman slave, while that
wild cry remained within hearing.  The Christian or civilized part of
the crew said it was mermaids, and shuddered; but the pagan
harpooneers remained unappalled.  Yet the grey Manxman--the oldest
mariner of all--declared that the wild thrilling sounds that were
heard, were the voices of newly drowned men in the sea.

Below in his hammock, Ahab did not hear of this till grey dawn, when
he came to the deck; it was then recounted to him by Flask, not
unaccompanied with hinted dark meanings.  He hollowly laughed, and
thus explained the wonder.

Those rocky islands the ship had passed were the resort of great
numbers of seals, and some young seals that had lost their dams, or
some dams that had lost their cubs, must have risen nigh the ship and
kept company with her, crying and sobbing with their human sort of
wail.  But this only the more affected some of them, because most
mariners cherish a very superstitious feeling about seals, arising
not only from their peculiar tones when in distress, but also from
the human look of their round heads and semi-intelligent faces, seen
peeringly uprising from the water alongside.  In the sea, under
certain circumstances, seals have more than once been mistaken for
men.

But the bodings of the crew were destined to receive a most plausible
confirmation in the fate of one of their number that morning.  At
sun-rise this man went from his hammock to his mast-head at the fore;
and whether it was that he was not yet half waked from his sleep (for
sailors sometimes go aloft in a transition state), whether it was
thus with the man, there is now no telling; but, be that as it may,
he had not been long at his perch, when a cry was heard--a cry and a
rushing--and looking up, they saw a falling phantom in the air; and
looking down, a little tossed heap of white bubbles in the blue of
the sea.

The life-buoy--a long slender cask--was dropped from the stern, where
it always hung obedient to a cunning spring; but no hand rose to
seize it, and the sun having long beat upon this cask it had
shrunken, so that it slowly filled, and that parched wood also
filled at its every pore; and the studded iron-bound cask followed
the sailor to the bottom, as if to yield him his pillow, though in
sooth but a hard one.

And thus the first man of the Pequod that mounted the mast to look
out for the White Whale, on the White Whale's own peculiar ground;
that man was swallowed up in the deep.  But few, perhaps, thought of
that at the time.  Indeed, in some sort, they were not grieved at
this event, at least as a portent; for they regarded it, not as a
foreshadowing of evil in the future, but as the fulfilment of an
evil already presaged.  They declared that now they knew the reason
of those wild shrieks they had heard the night before.  But again the
old Manxman said nay.

The lost life-buoy was now to be replaced; Starbuck was directed to
see to it; but as no cask of sufficient lightness could be found, and
as in the feverish eagerness of what seemed the approaching crisis of
the voyage, all hands were impatient of any toil but what was
directly connected with its final end, whatever that might prove to
be; therefore, they were going to leave the ship's stern unprovided
with a buoy, when by certain strange signs and inuendoes Queequeg
hinted a hint concerning his coffin.

A life-buoy of a coffin! cried Starbuck, starting.

Rather queer, that, I should say, said Stubb.

It will make a good enough one, said Flask, the carpenter here can"
8681	"arrange it easily.

Bring it up; there's nothing else for it, said Starbuck, after a
melancholy pause.  Rig it, carpenter; do not look at me so--the"
8682	"coffin, I mean.  Dost thou hear me?  Rig it.

And shall I nail down the lid, sir? moving his hand as with a
hammer.

Aye.

And shall I caulk the seams, sir? moving his hand as with a
caulking-iron.

Aye.

And shall I then pay over the same with pitch, sir? moving his hand
as with a pitch-pot.

Away! what possesses thee to this?  Make a life-buoy of the coffin,"
8683	"and no more.--Mr. Stubb, Mr. Flask, come forward with me.

He goes off in a huff.  The whole he can endure; at the parts he"
8684	baulks.  Now I don't like this.  I make a leg for Captain Ahab, and
8685	he wears it like a gentleman; but I make a bandbox for Queequeg, and
8686	he won't put his head into it.  Are all my pains to go for nothing
8687	with that coffin?  And now I'm ordered to make a life-buoy of it.
8688	It's like turning an old coat; going to bring the flesh on the other
8689	side now.  I don't like this cobbling sort of business--I don't like
8690	it at all; it's undignified; it's not my place.  Let tinkers' brats
8691	do tinkerings; we are their betters.  I like to take in hand none but
8692	clean, virgin, fair-and-square mathematical jobs, something that
8693	regularly begins at the beginning, and is at the middle when midway,
8694	and comes to an end at the conclusion; not a cobbler's job, that's at
8695	an end in the middle, and at the beginning at the end.  It's the old
8696	woman's tricks to be giving cobbling jobs.  Lord! what an affection
8697	all old women have for tinkers.  I know an old woman of sixty-five
8698	who ran away with a bald-headed young tinker once.  And that's the
8699	reason I never would work for lonely widow old women ashore, when I
8700	kept my job-shop in the Vineyard; they might have taken it into their
8701	lonely old heads to run off with me.  But heigh-ho! there are no caps
8702	at sea but snow-caps.  Let me see.  Nail down the lid; caulk the
8703	seams; pay over the same with pitch; batten them down tight, and hang
8704	it with the snap-spring over the ship's stern.  Were ever such things
8705	done before with a coffin?  Some superstitious old carpenters, now,
8706	would be tied up in the rigging, ere they would do the job.  But I'm
8707	made of knotty Aroostook hemlock; I don't budge.  Cruppered with a
8708	coffin!  Sailing about with a grave-yard tray!  But never mind.  We
8709	workers in woods make bridal-bedsteads and card-tables, as well as
8710	coffins and hearses.  We work by the month, or by the job, or by the
8711	profit; not for us to ask the why and wherefore of our work, unless
8712	it be too confounded cobbling, and then we stash it if we can.  Hem!
8713	I'll do the job, now, tenderly.  I'll have me--let's see--how many in
8714	the ship's company, all told?  But I've forgotten.  Any way, I'll
8715	have me thirty separate, Turk's-headed life-lines, each three feet
8716	long hanging all round to the coffin.  Then, if the hull go down,
8717	there'll be thirty lively fellows all fighting for one coffin, a
8718	sight not seen very often beneath the sun!  Come hammer,
8719	"caulking-iron, pitch-pot, and marling-spike!  Let's to it.



CHAPTER 127

The Deck.


THE COFFIN LAID UPON TWO LINE-TUBS, BETWEEN THE VICE-BENCH AND THE
OPEN HATCHWAY; THE CARPENTER CAULKING ITS SEAMS; THE STRING OF
TWISTED OAKUM SLOWLY UNWINDING FROM A LARGE ROLL OF IT PLACED IN THE
BOSOM OF HIS FROCK.--AHAB COMES SLOWLY FROM THE CABIN-GANGWAY, AND
HEARS PIP FOLLOWING HIM.


Back, lad; I will be with ye again presently.  He goes!  Not this
hand complies with my humor more genially than that boy.--Middle
aisle of a church!  What's here?"
8720	
8721	"Life-buoy, sir.  Mr. Starbuck's orders.  Oh, look, sir!  Beware the
hatchway!"
8722	
8723	Thank ye, man.  Thy coffin lies handy to the vault.
8724	
8725	Sir?  The hatchway? oh!  So it does, sir, so it does.
8726	
8727	"Art not thou the leg-maker?  Look, did not this stump come from thy
shop?"
8728	
8729	I believe it did, sir; does the ferrule stand, sir?
8730	
8731	Well enough.  But art thou not also the undertaker?
8732	
8733	"Aye, sir; I patched up this thing here as a coffin for Queequeg; but
they've set me now to turning it into something else."
8734	
8735	"Then tell me; art thou not an arrant, all-grasping, intermeddling,
monopolising, heathenish old scamp, to be one day making legs, and
the next day coffins to clap them in, and yet again life-buoys out of
those same coffins?  Thou art as unprincipled as the gods, and as
much of a jack-of-all-trades."
8736	
8737	But I do not mean anything, sir.  I do as I do.
8738	
8739	"The gods again.  Hark ye, dost thou not ever sing working about a
coffin?  The Titans, they say, hummed snatches when chipping out the
craters for volcanoes; and the grave-digger in the play sings, spade
in hand.  Dost thou never?"
8740	
8741	"Sing, sir?  Do I sing?  Oh, I'm indifferent enough, sir, for that;
but the reason why the grave-digger made music must have been because
there was none in his spade, sir.  But the caulking mallet is full of
it.  Hark to it."
8742	
8743	"Aye, and that's because the lid there's a sounding-board; and what
in all things makes the sounding-board is this--there's naught
beneath.  And yet, a coffin with a body in it rings pretty much the
same, Carpenter.  Hast thou ever helped carry a bier, and heard the
coffin knock against the churchyard gate, going in?

Faith, sir, I've--

Faith?  What's that?

Why, faith, sir, it's only a sort of exclamation-like--that's all,"
8744	"sir.

Um, um; go on.

I was about to say, sir, that--

Art thou a silk-worm?  Dost thou spin thy own shroud out of thyself?"
8745	"Look at thy bosom!  Despatch! and get these traps out of sight.

He goes aft.  That was sudden, now; but squalls come sudden in hot"
8746	latitudes.  I've heard that the Isle of Albemarle, one of the
8747	Gallipagos, is cut by the Equator right in the middle.  Seems to me
8748	some sort of Equator cuts yon old man, too, right in his middle.
8749	He's always under the Line--fiery hot, I tell ye!  He's looking this
8750	way--come, oakum; quick.  Here we go again.  This wooden mallet is
8751	"the cork, and I'm the professor of musical glasses--tap, tap!

(AHAB TO HIMSELF.)

There's a sight!  There's a sound!  The grey-headed woodpecker"
8752	tapping the hollow tree!  Blind and dumb might well be envied now.
8753	See! that thing rests on two line-tubs, full of tow-lines.  A most
8754	malicious wag, that fellow.  Rat-tat!  So man's seconds tick!  Oh!
8755	how immaterial are all materials!  What things real are there, but
8756	imponderable thoughts?  Here now's the very dreaded symbol of grim
8757	death, by a mere hap, made the expressive sign of the help and hope
8758	of most endangered life.  A life-buoy of a coffin!  Does it go
8759	further?  Can it be that in some spiritual sense the coffin is, after
8760	all, but an immortality-preserver!  I'll think of that.  But no.  So
8761	far gone am I in the dark side of earth, that its other side, the

8763	never have done, Carpenter, with that accursed sound?  I go below;

CHAPTER 128

The Pequod Meets The Rachel.


Next day, a large ship, the Rachel, was descried, bearing directly
down upon the Pequod, all her spars thickly clustering with men.  At
the time the Pequod was making good speed through the water; but as
the broad-winged windward stranger shot nigh to her, the boastful
sails all fell together as blank bladders that are burst, and all
life fled from the smitten hull.

Bad news; she brings bad news, muttered the old Manxman.  But ere
her commander, who, with trumpet to mouth, stood up in his boat; ere
he could hopefully hail, Ahab's voice was heard.

Hast seen the White Whale?

Aye, yesterday.  Have ye seen a whale-boat adrift?

Throttling his joy, Ahab negatively answered this unexpected
question; and would then have fain boarded the stranger, when the
stranger captain himself, having stopped his vessel's way, was seen
descending her side.  A few keen pulls, and his boat-hook soon
clinched the Pequod's main-chains, and he sprang to the deck.
Immediately he was recognised by Ahab for a Nantucketer he knew.  But
no formal salutation was exchanged.

Where was he?--not killed!--not killed! cried Ahab, closely
advancing.  How was it?

It seemed that somewhat late on the afternoon of the day previous,
while three of the stranger's boats were engaged with a shoal of
whales, which had led them some four or five miles from the ship; and
while they were yet in swift chase to windward, the white hump and
head of Moby Dick had suddenly loomed up out of the water, not very
far to leeward; whereupon, the fourth rigged boat--a reserved
one--had been instantly lowered in chase.  After a keen sail before
the wind, this fourth boat--the swiftest keeled of all--seemed to
have succeeded in fastening--at least, as well as the man at the
mast-head could tell anything about it.  In the distance he saw the
diminished dotted boat; and then a swift gleam of bubbling white
water; and after that nothing more; whence it was concluded that the
stricken whale must have indefinitely run away with his pursuers, as
often happens.  There was some apprehension, but no positive alarm,
as yet.  The recall signals were placed in the rigging; darkness came
on; and forced to pick up her three far to windward boats--ere going
in quest of the fourth one in the precisely opposite direction--the
ship had not only been necessitated to leave that boat to its fate
till near midnight, but, for the time, to increase her distance from
it.  But the rest of her crew being at last safe aboard, she crowded
all sail--stunsail on stunsail--after the missing boat; kindling a
fire in her try-pots for a beacon; and every other man aloft on the
look-out.  But though when she had thus sailed a sufficient distance
to gain the presumed place of the absent ones when last seen; though
she then paused to lower her spare boats to pull all around her; and
not finding anything, had again dashed on; again paused, and lowered
her boats; and though she had thus continued doing till daylight;
yet not the least glimpse of the missing keel had been seen.

The story told, the stranger Captain immediately went on to reveal
his object in boarding the Pequod.  He desired that ship to unite
with his own in the search; by sailing over the sea some four or five
miles apart, on parallel lines, and so sweeping a double horizon, as
it were.

I will wager something now, whispered Stubb to Flask, that some"
8767	one in that missing boat wore off that Captain's best coat; mayhap,
8768	his watch--he's so cursed anxious to get it back.  Who ever heard of
8769	two pious whale-ships cruising after one missing whale-boat in the
8770	height of the whaling season?  See, Flask, only see how pale he
8771	looks--pale in the very buttons of his eyes--look--it wasn't the
8772	"coat--it must have been the--

My boy, my own boy is among them.  For God's sake--I beg, I"
8773	"conjure--here exclaimed the stranger Captain to Ahab, who thus far
had but icily received his petition.  For eight-and-forty hours let"
8774	me charter your ship--I will gladly pay for it, and roundly pay for
8775	it--if there be no other way--for eight-and-forty hours only--only
8776	"that--you must, oh, you must, and you SHALL do this thing.

His son! cried Stubb, oh, it's his son he's lost!  I take back the"
8777	"coat and watch--what says Ahab?  We must save that boy.

He's drowned with the rest on 'em, last night, said the old Manx
sailor standing behind them; I heard; all of ye heard their"
8778	"spirits.

Now, as it shortly turned out, what made this incident of the
Rachel's the more melancholy, was the circumstance, that not only was
one of the Captain's sons among the number of the missing boat's
crew; but among the number of the other boat's crews, at the same
time, but on the other hand, separated from the ship during the dark
vicissitudes of the chase, there had been still another son; as that
for a time, the wretched father was plunged to the bottom of the
cruellest perplexity; which was only solved for him by his chief
mate's instinctively adopting the ordinary procedure of a whale-ship
in such emergencies, that is, when placed between jeopardized but
divided boats, always to pick up the majority first.  But the
captain, for some unknown constitutional reason, had refrained from
mentioning all this, and not till forced to it by Ahab's iciness did
he allude to his one yet missing boy; a little lad, but twelve years
old, whose father with the earnest but unmisgiving hardihood of a
Nantucketer's paternal love, had thus early sought to initiate him in
the perils and wonders of a vocation almost immemorially the destiny
of all his race.  Nor does it unfrequently occur, that Nantucket
captains will send a son of such tender age away from them, for a
protracted three or four years' voyage in some other ship than their
own; so that their first knowledge of a whaleman's career shall be
unenervated by any chance display of a father's natural but untimely
partiality, or undue apprehensiveness and concern.

Meantime, now the stranger was still beseeching his poor boon of
Ahab; and Ahab still stood like an anvil, receiving every shock, but
without the least quivering of his own.

I will not go, said the stranger, till you say aye to me.  Do to"
8779	me as you would have me do to you in the like case.  For YOU too have
8780	a boy, Captain Ahab--though but a child, and nestling safely at home
8781	now--a child of your old age too--Yes, yes, you relent; I see
8782	"it--run, run, men, now, and stand by to square in the yards.

Avast, cried Ahab--touch not a rope-yarn; then in a voice that
prolongingly moulded every word--Captain Gardiner, I will not do it."
8783	Even now I lose time.  Good-bye, good-bye.  God bless ye, man, and
8784	may I forgive myself, but I must go.  Mr. Starbuck, look at the
8785	binnacle watch, and in three minutes from this present instant warn
8786	off all strangers: then brace forward again, and let the ship sail
8787	"as before.

Hurriedly turning, with averted face, he descended into his cabin,
leaving the strange captain transfixed at this unconditional and
utter rejection of his so earnest suit.  But starting from his
enchantment, Gardiner silently hurried to the side; more fell than
stepped into his boat, and returned to his ship.

Soon the two ships diverged their wakes; and long as the strange
vessel was in view, she was seen to yaw hither and thither at every
dark spot, however small, on the sea.  This way and that her yards
were swung round; starboard and larboard, she continued to tack;
now she beat against a head sea; and again it pushed her before it;
while all the while, her masts and yards were thickly clustered with
men, as three tall cherry trees, when the boys are cherrying among
the boughs.

But by her still halting course and winding, woeful way, you plainly
saw that this ship that so wept with spray, still remained without
comfort.  She was Rachel, weeping for her children, because they were
not.



CHAPTER 129

The Cabin.


(AHAB MOVING TO GO ON DECK; PIP CATCHES HIM BY THE HAND TO FOLLOW.)

Lad, lad, I tell thee thou must not follow Ahab now.  The hour is
coming when Ahab would not scare thee from him, yet would not have
thee by him.  There is that in thee, poor lad, which I feel too
curing to my malady.  Like cures like; and for this hunt, my malady
becomes my most desired health.  Do thou abide below here, where they
shall serve thee, as if thou wert the captain.  Aye, lad, thou shalt
sit here in my own screwed chair; another screw to it, thou must be."
8788	
8789	"No, no, no! ye have not a whole body, sir; do ye but use poor me for
your one lost leg; only tread upon me, sir; I ask no more, so I
remain a part of ye."
8790	
8791	"Oh! spite of million villains, this makes me a bigot in the fadeless
fidelity of man!--and a black! and crazy!--but methinks
like-cures-like applies to him too; he grows so sane again."
8792	
8793	"They tell me, sir, that Stubb did once desert poor little Pip, whose
drowned bones now show white, for all the blackness of his living
skin.  But I will never desert ye, sir, as Stubb did him.  Sir, I
must go with ye."
8794	
8795	"If thou speakest thus to me much more, Ahab's purpose keels up in
him.  I tell thee no; it cannot be."
8796	
8797	"Oh good master, master, master!

Weep so, and I will murder thee! have a care, for Ahab too is mad."
8798	Listen, and thou wilt often hear my ivory foot upon the deck, and
8799	still know that I am there.  And now I quit thee.  Thy hand!--Met!
8800	True art thou, lad, as the circumference to its centre.  So: God for
8801	ever bless thee; and if it come to that,--God for ever save thee, let
8802	"what will befall.

(AHAB GOES; PIP STEPS ONE STEP FORWARD.)


Here he this instant stood; I stand in his air,--but I'm alone."
8803	Now were even poor Pip here I could endure it, but he's missing.
8804	Pip!  Pip!  Ding, dong, ding!  Who's seen Pip?  He must be up here;
8805	let's try the door.  What? neither lock, nor bolt, nor bar; and yet
8806	there's no opening it.  It must be the spell; he told me to stay
8807	here: Aye, and told me this screwed chair was mine.  Here, then, I'll
8808	seat me, against the transom, in the ship's full middle, all her keel
8809	and her three masts before me.  Here, our old sailors say, in their
8810	black seventy-fours great admirals sometimes sit at table, and lord
8811	it over rows of captains and lieutenants.  Ha! what's this? epaulets!
8812	epaulets! the epaulets all come crowding!  Pass round the decanters;
8813	glad to see ye; fill up, monsieurs!  What an odd feeling, now, when a
8814	black boy's host to white men with gold lace upon their
8815	coats!--Monsieurs, have ye seen one Pip?--a little negro lad, five
8816	feet high, hang-dog look, and cowardly!  Jumped from a whale-boat
8817	once;--seen him?  No!  Well then, fill up again, captains, and let's
8818	drink shame upon all cowards!  I name no names.  Shame upon them!
8819	Put one foot upon the table.  Shame upon all cowards.--Hist! above
8820	there, I hear ivory--Oh, master! master!  I am indeed down-hearted
8821	when you walk over me.  But here I'll stay, though this stern
8822	"strikes rocks; and they bulge through; and oysters come to join me.



CHAPTER 130

The Hat.


And now that at the proper time and place, after so long and wide a
preliminary cruise, Ahab,--all other whaling waters swept--seemed to
have chased his foe into an ocean-fold, to slay him the more securely
there; now, that he found himself hard by the very latitude and
longitude where his tormenting wound had been inflicted; now that a
vessel had been spoken which on the very day preceding had actually
encountered Moby Dick;--and now that all his successive meetings with
various ships contrastingly concurred to show the demoniac
indifference with which the white whale tore his hunters, whether
sinning or sinned against; now it was that there lurked a something
in the old man's eyes, which it was hardly sufferable for feeble
souls to see.  As the unsetting polar star, which through the
livelong, arctic, six months' night sustains its piercing, steady,
central gaze; so Ahab's purpose now fixedly gleamed down upon the
constant midnight of the gloomy crew.  It domineered above them so,
that all their bodings, doubts, misgivings, fears, were fain to hide
beneath their souls, and not sprout forth a single spear or leaf.

In this foreshadowing interval too, all humor, forced or natural,
vanished.  Stubb no more strove to raise a smile; Starbuck no more
strove to check one.  Alike, joy and sorrow, hope and fear, seemed
ground to finest dust, and powdered, for the time, in the clamped
mortar of Ahab's iron soul.  Like machines, they dumbly moved about
the deck, ever conscious that the old man's despot eye was on them.

But did you deeply scan him in his more secret confidential hours;
when he thought no glance but one was on him; then you would have
seen that even as Ahab's eyes so awed the crew's, the inscrutable
Parsee's glance awed his; or somehow, at least, in some wild way, at
times affected it.  Such an added, gliding strangeness began to
invest the thin Fedallah now; such ceaseless shudderings shook him;
that the men looked dubious at him; half uncertain, as it seemed,
whether indeed he were a mortal substance, or else a tremulous shadow
cast upon the deck by some unseen being's body.  And that shadow was
always hovering there.  For not by night, even, had Fedallah ever
certainly been known to slumber, or go below.  He would stand still
for hours: but never sat or leaned; his wan but wondrous eyes did
plainly say--We two watchmen never rest.

Nor, at any time, by night or day could the mariners now step upon
the deck, unless Ahab was before them; either standing in his
pivot-hole, or exactly pacing the planks between two undeviating
limits,--the main-mast and the mizen; or else they saw him standing
in the cabin-scuttle,--his living foot advanced upon the deck, as if
to step; his hat slouched heavily over his eyes; so that however
motionless he stood, however the days and nights were added on, that
he had not swung in his hammock; yet hidden beneath that slouching
hat, they could never tell unerringly whether, for all this, his eyes
were really closed at times; or whether he was still intently
scanning them; no matter, though he stood so in the scuttle for a
whole hour on the stretch, and the unheeded night-damp gathered in
beads of dew upon that stone-carved coat and hat.  The clothes that
the night had wet, the next day's sunshine dried upon him; and so,
day after day, and night after night; he went no more beneath the
planks; whatever he wanted from the cabin that thing he sent for.

He ate in the same open air; that is, his two only meals,--breakfast
and dinner: supper he never touched; nor reaped his beard; which
darkly grew all gnarled, as unearthed roots of trees blown over,
which still grow idly on at naked base, though perished in the upper
verdure.  But though his whole life was now become one watch on deck;
and though the Parsee's mystic watch was without intermission as his
own; yet these two never seemed to speak--one man to the
other--unless at long intervals some passing unmomentous matter made
it necessary.  Though such a potent spell seemed secretly to join the
twain; openly, and to the awe-struck crew, they seemed pole-like
asunder.  If by day they chanced to speak one word; by night, dumb
men were both, so far as concerned the slightest verbal interchange.
At times, for longest hours, without a single hail, they stood far
parted in the starlight; Ahab in his scuttle, the Parsee by the
mainmast; but still fixedly gazing upon each other; as if in the
Parsee Ahab saw his forethrown shadow, in Ahab the Parsee his
abandoned substance.

And yet, somehow, did Ahab--in his own proper self, as daily, hourly,
and every instant, commandingly revealed to his subordinates,--Ahab
seemed an independent lord; the Parsee but his slave.  Still again
both seemed yoked together, and an unseen tyrant driving them; the
lean shade siding the solid rib.  For be this Parsee what he may, all
rib and keel was solid Ahab.

At the first faintest glimmering of the dawn, his iron voice was
heard from aft,--Man the mast-heads!--and all through the day,
till after sunset and after twilight, the same voice every hour, at
the striking of the helmsman's bell, was heard--What d'ye"
8823	"see?--sharp! sharp!

But when three or four days had slided by, after meeting the
children-seeking Rachel; and no spout had yet been seen; the
monomaniac old man seemed distrustful of his crew's fidelity; at
least, of nearly all except the Pagan harpooneers; he seemed to
doubt, even, whether Stubb and Flask might not willingly overlook the
sight he sought.  But if these suspicions were really his, he
sagaciously refrained from verbally expressing them, however his
actions might seem to hint them.

I will have the first sight of the whale myself,--he said.  Aye!"
8824	Ahab must have the doubloon! and with his own hands he rigged a nest
8825	of basketed bowlines; and sending a hand aloft, with a single sheaved
8826	block, to secure to the main-mast head, he received the two ends of
8827	the downward-reeved rope; and attaching one to his basket prepared a
8828	pin for the other end, in order to fasten it at the rail.  This done,
8829	with that end yet in his hand and standing beside the pin, he looked
8830	round upon his crew, sweeping from one to the other; pausing his
8831	glance long upon Daggoo, Queequeg, Tashtego; but shunning Fedallah;
8832	and then settling his firm relying eye upon the chief mate,
8833	said,--Take the rope, sir--I give it into thy hands, Starbuck.
8834	Then arranging his person in the basket, he gave the word for them to
8835	hoist him to his perch, Starbuck being the one who secured the rope
8836	at last; and afterwards stood near it.  And thus, with one hand
8837	clinging round the royal mast, Ahab gazed abroad upon the sea for
8838	miles and miles,--ahead, astern, this side, and that,--within the
8839	wide expanded circle commanded at so great a height.
8840	
8841	When in working with his hands at some lofty almost isolated place in
8842	the rigging, which chances to afford no foothold, the sailor at sea
8843	is hoisted up to that spot, and sustained there by the rope; under
8844	these circumstances, its fastened end on deck is always given in
8845	strict charge to some one man who has the special watch of it.
8846	Because in such a wilderness of running rigging, whose various
8847	different relations aloft cannot always be infallibly discerned by
8848	what is seen of them at the deck; and when the deck-ends of these
8849	ropes are being every few minutes cast down from the fastenings, it
8850	would be but a natural fatality, if, unprovided with a constant
8851	watchman, the hoisted sailor should by some carelessness of the crew
8852	be cast adrift and fall all swooping to the sea.  So Ahab's
8853	proceedings in this matter were not unusual; the only strange thing
8854	about them seemed to be, that Starbuck, almost the one only man who
8855	had ever ventured to oppose him with anything in the slightest degree
8856	approaching to decision--one of those too, whose faithfulness on the
8857	look-out he had seemed to doubt somewhat;--it was strange, that this
8858	was the very man he should select for his watchman; freely giving his
8859	whole life into such an otherwise distrusted person's hands.
8860	
8861	Now, the first time Ahab was perched aloft; ere he had been there ten
8862	minutes; one of those red-billed savage sea-hawks which so often fly
8863	incommodiously close round the manned mast-heads of whalemen in these
8864	latitudes; one of these birds came wheeling and screaming round his
8865	head in a maze of untrackably swift circlings.  Then it darted a
8866	thousand feet straight up into the air; then spiralized downwards,
8867	and went eddying again round his head.
8868	
8869	But with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon, Ahab seemed
8870	not to mark this wild bird; nor, indeed, would any one else have
8871	marked it much, it being no uncommon circumstance; only now almost
8872	the least heedful eye seemed to see some sort of cunning meaning in
8873	almost every sight.
8874	
8875	Your hat, your hat, sir! suddenly cried the Sicilian seaman, who
8876	being posted at the mizen-mast-head, stood directly behind Ahab,
8877	though somewhat lower than his level, and with a deep gulf of air
8878	dividing them.
8879	
8880	But already the sable wing was before the old man's eyes; the long
8881	hooked bill at his head: with a scream, the black hawk darted away
8882	with his prize.
8883	
8884	An eagle flew thrice round Tarquin's head, removing his cap to
8885	replace it, and thereupon Tanaquil, his wife, declared that Tarquin
8886	would be king of Rome.  But only by the replacing of the cap was that
8887	omen accounted good.  Ahab's hat was never restored; the wild hawk
8888	flew on and on with it; far in advance of the prow: and at last
8889	disappeared; while from the point of that disappearance, a minute
8890	black spot was dimly discerned, falling from that vast height into
8891	the sea.
8892	
8893	
8894	
8895	CHAPTER 131
8896	
8897	The Pequod Meets The Delight.
8898	
8899	
8900	The intense Pequod sailed on; the rolling waves and days went by; the
8901	life-buoy-coffin still lightly swung; and another ship, most
8902	miserably misnamed the Delight, was descried.  As she drew nigh, all
8903	eyes were fixed upon her broad beams, called shears, which, in some
8904	whaling-ships, cross the quarter-deck at the height of eight or nine
8905	feet; serving to carry the spare, unrigged, or disabled boats.
8906	
8907	Upon the stranger's shears were beheld the shattered, white ribs, and
8908	some few splintered planks, of what had once been a whale-boat; but
8909	you now saw through this wreck, as plainly as you see through the
8910	peeled, half-unhinged, and bleaching skeleton of a horse.
8911	
8912	Hast seen the White Whale?
8913	
8914	Look! replied the hollow-cheeked captain from his taffrail; and
8915	with his trumpet he pointed to the wreck.
8916	
8917	Hast killed him?
8918	
8919	The harpoon is not yet forged that ever will do that, answered the
8920	other, sadly glancing upon a rounded hammock on the deck, whose
8921	gathered sides some noiseless sailors were busy in sewing together.
8922	
8923	Not forged! and snatching Perth's levelled iron from the crotch,
8924	"Ahab held it out, exclaiming--Look ye, Nantucketer; here in this
hand I hold his death!  Tempered in blood, and tempered by lightning
are these barbs; and I swear to temper them triply in that hot place
behind the fin, where the White Whale most feels his accursed life!"
8925	
8926	Then God keep thee, old man--see'st thou that--pointing to the
8927	"hammock--I bury but one of five stout men, who were alive only
yesterday; but were dead ere night.  Only THAT one I bury; the rest
were buried before they died; you sail upon their tomb.  Then"
8928	"turning to his crew--Are ye ready there? place the plank then on the
rail, and lift the body; so, then--Oh!  God--advancing towards the"
8929	hammock with uplifted hands--may the resurrection and the life--
8930	
8931	Brace forward!  Up helm! cried Ahab like lightning to his men.
8932	
8933	But the suddenly started Pequod was not quick enough to escape the
8934	sound of the splash that the corpse soon made as it struck the sea;
8935	not so quick, indeed, but that some of the flying bubbles might have
8936	sprinkled her hull with their ghostly baptism.
8937	
8938	As Ahab now glided from the dejected Delight, the strange life-buoy
8939	hanging at the Pequod's stern came into conspicuous relief.
8940	
8941	Ha! yonder! look yonder, men! cried a foreboding voice in her wake.
8942	"In vain, oh, ye strangers, ye fly our sad burial; ye but turn us
your taffrail to show us your coffin!"
8943	
8944	
8945	
8946	CHAPTER 132
8947	
8948	The Symphony.
8949	
8950	
8951	It was a clear steel-blue day.  The firmaments of air and sea were
8952	hardly separable in that all-pervading azure; only, the pensive air
8953	was transparently pure and soft, with a woman's look, and the robust
8954	and man-like sea heaved with long, strong, lingering swells, as
8955	Samson's chest in his sleep.
8956	
8957	Hither, and thither, on high, glided the snow-white wings of small,
8958	unspeckled birds; these were the gentle thoughts of the feminine air;
8959	but to and fro in the deeps, far down in the bottomless blue, rushed
8960	mighty leviathans, sword-fish, and sharks; and these were the strong,
8961	troubled, murderous thinkings of the masculine sea.
8962	
8963	But though thus contrasting within, the contrast was only in shades
8964	and shadows without; those two seemed one; it was only the sex, as it
8965	were, that distinguished them.
8966	
8967	Aloft, like a royal czar and king, the sun seemed giving this gentle
8968	air to this bold and rolling sea; even as bride to groom.  And at the
8969	girdling line of the horizon, a soft and tremulous motion--most seen
8970	here at the Equator--denoted the fond, throbbing trust, the loving
8971	alarms, with which the poor bride gave her bosom away.
8972	
8973	Tied up and twisted; gnarled and knotted with wrinkles; haggardly
8974	firm and unyielding; his eyes glowing like coals, that still glow in
8975	the ashes of ruin; untottering Ahab stood forth in the clearness of
8976	the morn; lifting his splintered helmet of a brow to the fair girl's
8977	forehead of heaven.
8978	
8979	Oh, immortal infancy, and innocency of the azure!  Invisible winged
8980	creatures that frolic all round us!  Sweet childhood of air and sky!
8981	how oblivious were ye of old Ahab's close-coiled woe!  But so have I
8982	seen little Miriam and Martha, laughing-eyed elves, heedlessly gambol
8983	around their old sire; sporting with the circle of singed locks which
8984	grew on the marge of that burnt-out crater of his brain.
8985	
8986	Slowly crossing the deck from the scuttle, Ahab leaned over the side
8987	and watched how his shadow in the water sank and sank to his gaze,
8988	the more and the more that he strove to pierce the profundity.  But
8989	the lovely aromas in that enchanted air did at last seem to dispel,
8990	for a moment, the cankerous thing in his soul.  That glad, happy air,
8991	that winsome sky, did at last stroke and caress him; the step-mother
8992	world, so long cruel--forbidding--now threw affectionate arms round
8993	his stubborn neck, and did seem to joyously sob over him, as if over
8994	one, that however wilful and erring, she could yet find it in her
8995	heart to save and to bless.  From beneath his slouched hat Ahab
8996	dropped a tear into the sea; nor did all the Pacific contain such
8997	wealth as that one wee drop.
8998	
8999	Starbuck saw the old man; saw him, how he heavily leaned over the
9000	side; and he seemed to hear in his own true heart the measureless
9001	sobbing that stole out of the centre of the serenity around.  Careful
9002	not to touch him, or be noticed by him, he yet drew near to him, and
9003	stood there.
9004	
9005	Ahab turned.
9006	
9007	Starbuck!
9008	
9009	Sir.
9010	
9011	"Oh, Starbuck! it is a mild, mild wind, and a mild looking sky.  On
such a day--very much such a sweetness as this--I struck my first
whale--a boy-harpooneer of eighteen!  Forty--forty--forty years
ago!--ago!  Forty years of continual whaling! forty years of
privation, and peril, and storm-time! forty years on the pitiless
sea! for forty years has Ahab forsaken the peaceful land, for forty
years to make war on the horrors of the deep!  Aye and yes, Starbuck,
out of those forty years I have not spent three ashore.  When I think
of this life I have led; the desolation of solitude it has been; the
masoned, walled-town of a Captain's exclusiveness, which admits but
small entrance to any sympathy from the green country without--oh,
weariness! heaviness!  Guinea-coast slavery of solitary
command!--when I think of all this; only half-suspected, not so
keenly known to me before--and how for forty years I have fed upon
dry salted fare--fit emblem of the dry nourishment of my soil!--when
the poorest landsman has had fresh fruit to his daily hand, and
broken the world's fresh bread to my mouldy crusts--away, whole
oceans away, from that young girl-wife I wedded past fifty, and
sailed for Cape Horn the next day, leaving but one dent in my
marriage pillow--wife? wife?--rather a widow with her husband alive!
Aye, I widowed that poor girl when I married her, Starbuck; and
then, the madness, the frenzy, the boiling blood and the smoking
brow, with which, for a thousand lowerings old Ahab has furiously,
foamingly chased his prey--more a demon than a man!--aye, aye! what a
forty years' fool--fool--old fool, has old Ahab been!  Why this
strife of the chase? why weary, and palsy the arm at the oar, and the
iron, and the lance? how the richer or better is Ahab now?  Behold.
Oh, Starbuck! is it not hard, that with this weary load I bear, one
poor leg should have been snatched from under me?  Here, brush this
old hair aside; it blinds me, that I seem to weep.  Locks so grey did
never grow but from out some ashes!  But do I look very old, so very,
very old, Starbuck?  I feel deadly faint, bowed, and humped, as
though I were Adam, staggering beneath the piled centuries since
Paradise.  God!  God!  God!--crack my heart!--stave my
brain!--mockery! mockery! bitter, biting mockery of grey hairs, have
I lived enough joy to wear ye; and seem and feel thus intolerably
old?  Close! stand close to me, Starbuck; let me look into a human
eye; it is better than to gaze into sea or sky; better than to gaze
upon God.  By the green land; by the bright hearth-stone! this is the
magic glass, man; I see my wife and my child in thine eye.  No, no;
stay on board, on board!--lower not when I do; when branded Ahab
gives chase to Moby Dick.  That hazard shall not be thine.  No, no!
not with the far away home I see in that eye!"
9012	
9013	"Oh, my Captain! my Captain! noble soul! grand old heart, after all!
why should any one give chase to that hated fish!  Away with me! let
us fly these deadly waters! let us home!  Wife and child, too, are
Starbuck's--wife and child of his brotherly, sisterly, play-fellow
youth; even as thine, sir, are the wife and child of thy loving,
longing, paternal old age!  Away! let us away!--this instant let me
alter the course!  How cheerily, how hilariously, O my Captain, would
we bowl on our way to see old Nantucket again!  I think, sir, they
have some such mild blue days, even as this, in Nantucket."
9014	
9015	"They have, they have.  I have seen them--some summer days in the
morning.  About this time--yes, it is his noon nap now--the boy
vivaciously wakes; sits up in bed; and his mother tells him of me, of
cannibal old me; how I am abroad upon the deep, but will yet come
back to dance him again."
9016	
9017	"'Tis my Mary, my Mary herself!  She promised that my boy, every
morning, should be carried to the hill to catch the first glimpse of
his father's sail!  Yes, yes! no more! it is done! we head for
Nantucket!  Come, my Captain, study out the course, and let us away!
See, see! the boy's face from the window! the boy's hand on the
hill!"
9018	
9019	But Ahab's glance was averted; like a blighted fruit tree he shook,
9020	and cast his last, cindered apple to the soil.
9021	
9022	"What is it, what nameless, inscrutable, unearthly thing is it; what
cozening, hidden lord and master, and cruel, remorseless emperor
commands me; that against all natural lovings and longings, I so keep
pushing, and crowding, and jamming myself on all the time; recklessly
making me ready to do what in my own proper, natural heart, I durst
not so much as dare?  Is Ahab, Ahab?  Is it I, God, or who, that
lifts this arm?  But if the great sun move not of himself; but is as an
errand-boy in heaven; nor one single star can revolve, but by some
invisible power; how then can this one small heart beat; this one
small brain think thoughts; unless God does that beating, does that
thinking, does that living, and not I.  By heaven, man, we are turned
round and round in this world, like yonder windlass, and Fate is the
handspike.  And all the time, lo! that smiling sky, and this
unsounded sea!  Look! see yon Albicore! who put it into him to chase
and fang that flying-fish?  Where do murderers go, man!  Who's to
doom, when the judge himself is dragged to the bar?  But it is a
mild, mild wind, and a mild looking sky; and the air smells now, as
if it blew from a far-away meadow; they have been making hay
somewhere under the slopes of the Andes, Starbuck, and the mowers are
sleeping among the new-mown hay.  Sleeping?  Aye, toil we how we may,
we all sleep at last on the field.  Sleep?  Aye, and rust amid
greenness; as last year's scythes flung down, and left in the half-cut
swaths--Starbuck!"
9023	
9024	But blanched to a corpse's hue with despair, the Mate had stolen
9025	away.
9026	
9027	Ahab crossed the deck to gaze over on the other side; but started at
9028	two reflected, fixed eyes in the water there.  Fedallah was
9029	motionlessly leaning over the same rail.
9030	
9031	
9032	
9033	CHAPTER 133
9034	
9035	The Chase--First Day.
9036	
9037	
9038	That night, in the mid-watch, when the old man--as his wont at
9039	intervals--stepped forth from the scuttle in which he leaned, and
9040	went to his pivot-hole, he suddenly thrust out his face fiercely,
9041	snuffing up the sea air as a sagacious ship's dog will, in drawing
9042	nigh to some barbarous isle.  He declared that a whale must be near.
9043	Soon that peculiar odor, sometimes to a great distance given forth by
9044	the living sperm whale, was palpable to all the watch; nor was any
9045	mariner surprised when, after inspecting the compass, and then the
9046	dog-vane, and then ascertaining the precise bearing of the odor as
9047	nearly as possible, Ahab rapidly ordered the ship's course to be
9048	slightly altered, and the sail to be shortened.
9049	
9050	The acute policy dictating these movements was sufficiently
9051	vindicated at daybreak, by the sight of a long sleek on the sea
9052	directly and lengthwise ahead, smooth as oil, and resembling in the
9053	pleated watery wrinkles bordering it, the polished metallic-like
9054	marks of some swift tide-rip, at the mouth of a deep, rapid stream.
9055	
9056	Man the mast-heads!  Call all hands!
9057	
9058	Thundering with the butts of three clubbed handspikes on the
9059	forecastle deck, Daggoo roused the sleepers with such judgment claps
9060	that they seemed to exhale from the scuttle, so instantaneously did
9061	they appear with their clothes in their hands.
9062	
9063	What d'ye see? cried Ahab, flattening his face to the sky.
9064	
9065	Nothing, nothing sir! was the sound hailing down in reply.
9066	
9067	T'gallant sails!--stunsails! alow and aloft, and on both sides!
9068	
9069	All sail being set, he now cast loose the life-line, reserved for
9070	swaying him to the main royal-mast head; and in a few moments they
9071	were hoisting him thither, when, while but two thirds of the way
9072	aloft, and while peering ahead through the horizontal vacancy between
9073	the main-top-sail and top-gallant-sail, he raised a gull-like cry in
9074	"the air.  There she blows!--there she blows!  A hump like a
snow-hill!  It is Moby Dick!"
9075	
9076	Fired by the cry which seemed simultaneously taken up by the three
9077	look-outs, the men on deck rushed to the rigging to behold the famous
9078	whale they had so long been pursuing.  Ahab had now gained his final
9079	perch, some feet above the other look-outs, Tashtego standing just
9080	beneath him on the cap of the top-gallant-mast, so that the Indian's
9081	head was almost on a level with Ahab's heel.  From this height the
9082	whale was now seen some mile or so ahead, at every roll of the sea
9083	revealing his high sparkling hump, and regularly jetting his silent
9084	spout into the air.  To the credulous mariners it seemed the same
9085	silent spout they had so long ago beheld in the moonlit Atlantic and
9086	Indian Oceans.
9087	
9088	And did none of ye see it before? cried Ahab, hailing the perched
9089	men all around him.
9090	
9091	"I saw him almost that same instant, sir, that Captain Ahab did, and
I cried out, said Tashtego."
9092	
9093	"Not the same instant; not the same--no, the doubloon is mine, Fate
reserved the doubloon for me.  I only; none of ye could have raised
the White Whale first.  There she blows!--there she blows!--there
she blows!  There again!--there again! he cried, in long-drawn,"
9094	lingering, methodic tones, attuned to the gradual prolongings of the
9095	"whale's visible jets.  He's going to sound!  In stunsails!  Down
top-gallant-sails!  Stand by three boats.  Mr. Starbuck, remember,
stay on board, and keep the ship.  Helm there!  Luff, luff a point!
So; steady, man, steady!  There go flukes!  No, no; only black water!
All ready the boats there?  Stand by, stand by!  Lower me, Mr.
Starbuck; lower, lower,--quick, quicker! and he slid through the air"
9096	to the deck.
9097	
9098	"He is heading straight to leeward, sir, cried Stubb, right away
from us; cannot have seen the ship yet."
9099	
9100	"Be dumb, man!  Stand by the braces!  Hard down the helm!--brace up!
Shiver her!--shiver her!--So; well that!  Boats, boats!"
9101	
9102	Soon all the boats but Starbuck's were dropped; all the boat-sails
9103	set--all the paddles plying; with rippling swiftness, shooting to
9104	leeward; and Ahab heading the onset.  A pale, death-glimmer lit up
9105	Fedallah's sunken eyes; a hideous motion gnawed his mouth.
9106	
9107	Like noiseless nautilus shells, their light prows sped through the
9108	sea; but only slowly they neared the foe.  As they neared him, the
9109	ocean grew still more smooth; seemed drawing a carpet over its waves;
9110	seemed a noon-meadow, so serenely it spread.  At length the
9111	breathless hunter came so nigh his seemingly unsuspecting prey, that his
9112	entire dazzling hump was distinctly visible, sliding along the sea as
9113	if an isolated thing, and continually set in a revolving ring of
9114	finest, fleecy, greenish foam.  He saw the vast, involved wrinkles of
9115	the slightly projecting head beyond.  Before it, far out on the soft
9116	Turkish-rugged waters, went the glistening white shadow from his
9117	broad, milky forehead, a musical rippling playfully accompanying the
9118	shade; and behind, the blue waters interchangeably flowed over into
9119	the moving valley of his steady wake; and on either hand bright
9120	bubbles arose and danced by his side.  But these were broken again by
9121	the light toes of hundreds of gay fowl softly feathering the sea,
9122	alternate with their fitful flight; and like to some flag-staff
9123	rising from the painted hull of an argosy, the tall but shattered
9124	pole of a recent lance projected from the white whale's back; and at
9125	intervals one of the cloud of soft-toed fowls hovering, and to and
9126	fro skimming like a canopy over the fish, silently perched and rocked
9127	on this pole, the long tail feathers streaming like pennons.
9128	
9129	A gentle joyousness--a mighty mildness of repose in swiftness,
9130	invested the gliding whale.  Not the white bull Jupiter swimming away
9131	with ravished Europa clinging to his graceful horns; his lovely,
9132	leering eyes sideways intent upon the maid; with smooth bewitching
9133	fleetness, rippling straight for the nuptial bower in Crete; not
9134	Jove, not that great majesty Supreme! did surpass the glorified White
9135	Whale as he so divinely swam.
9136	
9137	On each soft side--coincident with the parted swell, that but once
9138	leaving him, then flowed so wide away--on each bright side, the whale
9139	shed off enticings.  No wonder there had been some among the hunters
9140	who namelessly transported and allured by all this serenity, had
9141	ventured to assail it; but had fatally found that quietude but the
9142	vesture of tornadoes.  Yet calm, enticing calm, oh, whale! thou
9143	glidest on, to all who for the first time eye thee, no matter how
9144	many in that same way thou may'st have bejuggled and destroyed
9145	before.
9146	
9147	And thus, through the serene tranquillities of the tropical sea,
9148	among waves whose hand-clappings were suspended by exceeding rapture,
9149	Moby Dick moved on, still withholding from sight the full terrors of
9150	his submerged trunk, entirely hiding the wrenched hideousness of his
9151	jaw.  But soon the fore part of him slowly rose from the water; for
9152	an instant his whole marbleized body formed a high arch, like
9153	Virginia's Natural Bridge, and warningly waving his bannered flukes
9154	in the air, the grand god revealed himself, sounded, and went out of
9155	sight.  Hoveringly halting, and dipping on the wing, the white
9156	sea-fowls longingly lingered over the agitated pool that he left.
9157	
9158	With oars apeak, and paddles down, the sheets of their sails adrift,
9159	the three boats now stilly floated, awaiting Moby Dick's
9160	reappearance.
9161	
9162	An hour, said Ahab, standing rooted in his boat's stern; and he
9163	gazed beyond the whale's place, towards the dim blue spaces and wide
9164	wooing vacancies to leeward.  It was only an instant; for again his
9165	eyes seemed whirling round in his head as he swept the watery circle.
9166	The breeze now freshened; the sea began to swell.
9167	
9168	The birds!--the birds! cried Tashtego.
9169	
9170	In long Indian file, as when herons take wing, the white birds were
9171	now all flying towards Ahab's boat; and when within a few yards began
9172	fluttering over the water there, wheeling round and round, with
9173	joyous, expectant cries.  Their vision was keener than man's; Ahab
9174	could discover no sign in the sea.  But suddenly as he peered down
9175	and down into its depths, he profoundly saw a white living spot no
9176	bigger than a white weasel, with wonderful celerity uprising, and
9177	magnifying as it rose, till it turned, and then there were plainly
9178	revealed two long crooked rows of white, glistening teeth, floating
9179	up from the undiscoverable bottom.  It was Moby Dick's open mouth and
9180	scrolled jaw; his vast, shadowed bulk still half blending with the
9181	blue of the sea.  The glittering mouth yawned beneath the boat like
9182	an open-doored marble tomb; and giving one sidelong sweep with his
9183	steering oar, Ahab whirled the craft aside from this tremendous
9184	apparition.  Then, calling upon Fedallah to change places with him,
9185	went forward to the bows, and seizing Perth's harpoon, commanded his
9186	crew to grasp their oars and stand by to stern.
9187	
9188	Now, by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis,
9189	its bow, by anticipation, was made to face the whale's head while yet
9190	under water.  But as if perceiving this stratagem, Moby Dick, with
9191	that malicious intelligence ascribed to him, sidelingly transplanted
9192	himself, as it were, in an instant, shooting his pleated head
9193	lengthwise beneath the boat.
9194	
9195	Through and through; through every plank and each rib, it thrilled
9196	for an instant, the whale obliquely lying on his back, in the manner
9197	of a biting shark, slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within
9198	his mouth, so that the long, narrow, scrolled lower jaw curled high
9199	up into the open air, and one of the teeth caught in a row-lock.  The
9200	bluish pearl-white of the inside of the jaw was within six inches of
9201	Ahab's head, and reached higher than that.  In this attitude the
9202	White Whale now shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her
9203	mouse.  With unastonished eyes Fedallah gazed, and crossed his arms;
9204	but the tiger-yellow crew were tumbling over each other's heads to
9205	gain the uttermost stern.
9206	
9207	And now, while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out, as
9208	the whale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way; and
9209	from his body being submerged beneath the boat, he could not be
9210	darted at from the bows, for the bows were almost inside of him, as
9211	it were; and while the other boats involuntarily paused, as before a
9212	quick crisis impossible to withstand, then it was that monomaniac
9213	Ahab, furious with this tantalizing vicinity of his foe, which placed
9214	him all alive and helpless in the very jaws he hated; frenzied with
9215	all this, he seized the long bone with his naked hands, and wildly
9216	strove to wrench it from its gripe.  As now he thus vainly strove,
9217	the jaw slipped from him; the frail gunwales bent in, collapsed, and
9218	snapped, as both jaws, like an enormous shears, sliding further aft,
9219	bit the craft completely in twain, and locked themselves fast again
9220	in the sea, midway between the two floating wrecks.  These floated
9221	aside, the broken ends drooping, the crew at the stern-wreck clinging
9222	to the gunwales, and striving to hold fast to the oars to lash them
9223	across.
9224	
9225	At that preluding moment, ere the boat was yet snapped, Ahab, the
9226	first to perceive the whale's intent, by the crafty upraising of his
9227	head, a movement that loosed his hold for the time; at that moment
9228	his hand had made one final effort to push the boat out of the bite.
9229	But only slipping further into the whale's mouth, and tilting over
9230	sideways as it slipped, the boat had shaken off his hold on the jaw;
9231	spilled him out of it, as he leaned to the push; and so he fell
9232	flat-faced upon the sea.
9233	
9234	Ripplingly withdrawing from his prey, Moby Dick now lay at a little
9235	distance, vertically thrusting his oblong white head up and down in
9236	the billows; and at the same time slowly revolving his whole spindled
9237	body; so that when his vast wrinkled forehead rose--some twenty or
9238	more feet out of the water--the now rising swells, with all their
9239	confluent waves, dazzlingly broke against it; vindictively tossing
9240	their shivered spray still higher into the air.*  So, in a gale, the
9241	but half baffled Channel billows only recoil from the base of the
9242	Eddystone, triumphantly to overleap its summit with their scud.
9243	
9244	
9245	*This motion is peculiar to the sperm whale.  It receives its
9246	designation (pitchpoling) from its being likened to that preliminary
9247	up-and-down poise of the whale-lance, in the exercise called
9248	pitchpoling, previously described.  By this motion the whale must
9249	best and most comprehensively view whatever objects may be encircling
9250	him.
9251	
9252	
9253	But soon resuming his horizontal attitude, Moby Dick swam swiftly
9254	round and round the wrecked crew; sideways churning the water in his
9255	vengeful wake, as if lashing himself up to still another and more
9256	deadly assault.  The sight of the splintered boat seemed to madden
9257	him, as the blood of grapes and mulberries cast before Antiochus's
9258	elephants in the book of Maccabees.  Meanwhile Ahab half smothered in
9259	the foam of the whale's insolent tail, and too much of a cripple to
9260	swim,--though he could still keep afloat, even in the heart of such a
9261	whirlpool as that; helpless Ahab's head was seen, like a tossed
9262	bubble which the least chance shock might burst.  From the boat's
9263	fragmentary stern, Fedallah incuriously and mildly eyed him; the
9264	clinging crew, at the other drifting end, could not succor him; more
9265	than enough was it for them to look to themselves.  For so
9266	revolvingly appalling was the White Whale's aspect, and so
9267	planetarily swift the ever-contracting circles he made, that he
9268	seemed horizontally swooping upon them.  And though the other boats,
9269	unharmed, still hovered hard by; still they dared not pull into the
9270	eddy to strike, lest that should be the signal for the instant
9271	destruction of the jeopardized castaways, Ahab and all; nor in that
9272	case could they themselves hope to escape.  With straining eyes,
9273	then, they remained on the outer edge of the direful zone, whose
9274	centre had now become the old man's head.
9275	
9276	Meantime, from the beginning all this had been descried from the
9277	ship's mast heads; and squaring her yards, she had borne down upon
9278	the scene; and was now so nigh, that Ahab in the water hailed
9279	her!--Sail on the--but that moment a breaking sea dashed on him
9280	from Moby Dick, and whelmed him for the time.  But struggling out of
9281	it again, and chancing to rise on a towering crest, he
9282	shouted,--Sail on the whale!--Drive him off!
9283	
9284	The Pequod's prows were pointed; and breaking up the charmed circle,
9285	she effectually parted the white whale from his victim.  As he
9286	sullenly swam off, the boats flew to the rescue.
9287	
9288	Dragged into Stubb's boat with blood-shot, blinded eyes, the white
9289	brine caking in his wrinkles; the long tension of Ahab's bodily
9290	strength did crack, and helplessly he yielded to his body's doom: for
9291	a time, lying all crushed in the bottom of Stubb's boat, like one
9292	trodden under foot of herds of elephants.  Far inland, nameless wails
9293	came from him, as desolate sounds from out ravines.
9294	
9295	But this intensity of his physical prostration did but so much the
9296	more abbreviate it.  In an instant's compass, great hearts sometimes
9297	condense to one deep pang, the sum total of those shallow pains
9298	kindly diffused through feebler men's whole lives.  And so, such
9299	hearts, though summary in each one suffering; still, if the gods
9300	decree it, in their life-time aggregate a whole age of woe, wholly
9301	made up of instantaneous intensities; for even in their pointless
9302	centres, those noble natures contain the entire circumferences of
9303	inferior souls.
9304	
9305	The harpoon, said Ahab, half way rising, and draggingly leaning on
9306	one bended arm--is it safe?
9307	
9308	Aye, sir, for it was not darted; this is it, said Stubb, showing
9309	it.
9310	
9311	Lay it before me;--any missing men?
9312	
9313	"One, two, three, four, five;--there were five oars, sir, and here
are five men."
9314	
9315	"That's good.--Help me, man; I wish to stand.  So, so, I see him!
there! there! going to leeward still; what a leaping spout!--Hands
off from me!  The eternal sap runs up in Ahab's bones again!  Set the
sail; out oars; the helm!"
9316	
9317	It is often the case that when a boat is stove, its crew, being
9318	picked up by another boat, help to work that second boat; and the
9319	chase is thus continued with what is called double-banked oars.  It
9320	was thus now.  But the added power of the boat did not equal the
9321	added power of the whale, for he seemed to have treble-banked his
9322	every fin; swimming with a velocity which plainly showed, that if
9323	now, under these circumstances, pushed on, the chase would prove an
9324	indefinitely prolonged, if not a hopeless one; nor could any crew
9325	endure for so long a period, such an unintermitted, intense straining
9326	at the oar; a thing barely tolerable only in some one brief
9327	vicissitude.  The ship itself, then, as it sometimes happens, offered
9328	the most promising intermediate means of overtaking the chase.
9329	Accordingly, the boats now made for her, and were soon swayed up to
9330	their cranes--the two parts of the wrecked boat having been
9331	previously secured by her--and then hoisting everything to her side,
9332	and stacking her canvas high up, and sideways outstretching it with
9333	stun-sails, like the double-jointed wings of an albatross; the Pequod
9334	bore down in the leeward wake of Moby-Dick.  At the well known,
9335	methodic intervals, the whale's glittering spout was regularly
9336	announced from the manned mast-heads; and when he would be reported
9337	as just gone down, Ahab would take the time, and then pacing the
9338	deck, binnacle-watch in hand, so soon as the last second of the
9339	"allotted hour expired, his voice was heard.--Whose is the doubloon
now?  D'ye see him? and if the reply was, No, sir! straightway he"
9340	commanded them to lift him to his perch.  In this way the day wore
9341	on; Ahab, now aloft and motionless; anon, unrestingly pacing the
9342	planks.
9343	
9344	As he was thus walking, uttering no sound, except to hail the men
9345	aloft, or to bid them hoist a sail still higher, or to spread one to
9346	a still greater breadth--thus to and fro pacing, beneath his slouched
9347	hat, at every turn he passed his own wrecked boat, which had been
9348	dropped upon the quarter-deck, and lay there reversed; broken bow to
9349	shattered stern.  At last he paused before it; and as in an already
9350	over-clouded sky fresh troops of clouds will sometimes sail across,
9351	so over the old man's face there now stole some such added gloom as
9352	this.
9353	
9354	Stubb saw him pause; and perhaps intending, not vainly, though, to
9355	evince his own unabated fortitude, and thus keep up a valiant place
9356	in his Captain's mind, he advanced, and eyeing the wreck
9357	"exclaimed--The thistle the ass refused; it pricked his mouth too
keenly, sir; ha! ha!"
9358	
9359	"What soulless thing is this that laughs before a wreck?  Man, man!
did I not know thee brave as fearless fire (and as mechanical) I
could swear thou wert a poltroon.  Groan nor laugh should be heard
before a wreck."
9360	
9361	"Aye, sir, said Starbuck drawing near, 'tis a solemn sight; an
omen, and an ill one."
9362	
9363	"Omen? omen?--the dictionary!  If the gods think to speak outright to
man, they will honourably speak outright; not shake their heads, and
give an old wives' darkling hint.--Begone!  Ye two are the opposite
poles of one thing; Starbuck is Stubb reversed, and Stubb is
Starbuck; and ye two are all mankind; and Ahab stands alone among the
millions of the peopled earth, nor gods nor men his neighbors!  Cold,
cold--I shiver!--How now?  Aloft there!  D'ye see him?  Sing out for
every spout, though he spout ten times a second!"
9364	
9365	The day was nearly done; only the hem of his golden robe was
9366	rustling.  Soon, it was almost dark, but the look-out men still
9367	remained unset.
9368	
9369	Can't see the spout now, sir;--too dark--cried a voice from the
9370	air.
9371	
9372	How heading when last seen?
9373	
9374	As before, sir,--straight to leeward.
9375	
9376	"Good! he will travel slower now 'tis night.  Down royals and
top-gallant stun-sails, Mr. Starbuck.  We must not run over him
before morning; he's making a passage now, and may heave-to a while.
Helm there! keep her full before the wind!--Aloft! come down!--Mr.
Stubb, send a fresh hand to the fore-mast head, and see it manned
till morning.--Then advancing towards the doubloon in the"
9377	"main-mast--Men, this gold is mine, for I earned it; but I shall let
it abide here till the White Whale is dead; and then, whosoever of ye
first raises him, upon the day he shall be killed, this gold is that
man's; and if on that day I shall again raise him, then, ten times
its sum shall be divided among all of ye!  Away now!--the deck is
thine, sir!"
9378	
9379	And so saying, he placed himself half way within the scuttle, and
9380	slouching his hat, stood there till dawn, except when at intervals
9381	rousing himself to see how the night wore on.
9382	
9383	
9384	
9385	CHAPTER 134
9386	
9387	The Chase--Second Day.
9388	
9389	
9390	At day-break, the three mast-heads were punctually manned afresh.
9391	
9392	D'ye see him? cried Ahab after allowing a little space for the
9393	light to spread.
9394	
9395	See nothing, sir.
9396	
9397	"Turn up all hands and make sail! he travels faster than I thought
for;--the top-gallant sails!--aye, they should have been kept on her
all night.  But no matter--'tis but resting for the rush."
9398	
9399	Here be it said, that this pertinacious pursuit of one particular
9400	whale, continued through day into night, and through night into day,
9401	is a thing by no means unprecedented in the South sea fishery.  For
9402	such is the wonderful skill, prescience of experience, and invincible
9403	confidence acquired by some great natural geniuses among the
9404	Nantucket commanders; that from the simple observation of a whale
9405	when last descried, they will, under certain given circumstances,
9406	pretty accurately foretell both the direction in which he will
9407	continue to swim for a time, while out of sight, as well as his
9408	probable rate of progression during that period.  And, in these
9409	cases, somewhat as a pilot, when about losing sight of a coast, whose
9410	general trending he well knows, and which he desires shortly to
9411	return to again, but at some further point; like as this pilot stands
9412	by his compass, and takes the precise bearing of the cape at present
9413	visible, in order the more certainly to hit aright the remote, unseen
9414	headland, eventually to be visited: so does the fisherman, at his
9415	compass, with the whale; for after being chased, and diligently
9416	marked, through several hours of daylight, then, when night obscures
9417	the fish, the creature's future wake through the darkness is almost
9418	as established to the sagacious mind of the hunter, as the pilot's
9419	coast is to him.  So that to this hunter's wondrous skill, the
9420	proverbial evanescence of a thing writ in water, a wake, is to all
9421	desired purposes well nigh as reliable as the steadfast land.  And as
9422	the mighty iron Leviathan of the modern railway is so familiarly
9423	known in its every pace, that, with watches in their hands, men time
9424	his rate as doctors that of a baby's pulse; and lightly say of it,
9425	the up train or the down train will reach such or such a spot, at
9426	such or such an hour; even so, almost, there are occasions when these
9427	Nantucketers time that other Leviathan of the deep, according to the
9428	observed humor of his speed; and say to themselves, so many hours
9429	hence this whale will have gone two hundred miles, will have about
9430	reached this or that degree of latitude or longitude.  But to render
9431	this acuteness at all successful in the end, the wind and the sea
9432	must be the whaleman's allies; for of what present avail to the
9433	becalmed or windbound mariner is the skill that assures him he is
9434	exactly ninety-three leagues and a quarter from his port?  Inferable
9435	from these statements, are many collateral subtile matters touching
9436	the chase of whales.
9437	
9438	The ship tore on; leaving such a furrow in the sea as when a
9439	cannon-ball, missent, becomes a plough-share and turns up the level
9440	field.
9441	
9442	"By salt and hemp! cried Stubb, but this swift motion of the deck
creeps up one's legs and tingles at the heart.  This ship and I are
two brave fellows!--Ha, ha!  Some one take me up, and launch me,
spine-wise, on the sea,--for by live-oaks! my spine's a keel.  Ha,
ha! we go the gait that leaves no dust behind!"
9443	
9444	There she blows--she blows!--she blows!--right ahead! was now the
9445	mast-head cry.
9446	
9447	"Aye, aye! cried Stubb, I knew it--ye can't escape--blow on and
split your spout, O whale! the mad fiend himself is after ye! blow
your trump--blister your lungs!--Ahab will dam off your blood, as a
miller shuts his watergate upon the stream!"
9448	
9449	And Stubb did but speak out for well nigh all that crew.  The
9450	frenzies of the chase had by this time worked them bubblingly up,
9451	like old wine worked anew.  Whatever pale fears and forebodings some
9452	of them might have felt before; these were not only now kept out of
9453	sight through the growing awe of Ahab, but they were broken up, and
9454	on all sides routed, as timid prairie hares that scatter before the
9455	bounding bison.  The hand of Fate had snatched all their souls; and
9456	by the stirring perils of the previous day; the rack of the past
9457	night's suspense; the fixed, unfearing, blind, reckless way in which
9458	their wild craft went plunging towards its flying mark; by all these
9459	things, their hearts were bowled along.  The wind that made great
9460	bellies of their sails, and rushed the vessel on by arms invisible as
9461	irresistible; this seemed the symbol of that unseen agency which so
9462	enslaved them to the race.
9463	
9464	They were one man, not thirty.  For as the one ship that held them
9465	all; though it was put together of all contrasting things--oak, and
9466	maple, and pine wood; iron, and pitch, and hemp--yet all these ran
9467	into each other in the one concrete hull, which shot on its way, both
9468	balanced and directed by the long central keel; even so, all the
9469	individualities of the crew, this man's valor, that man's fear; guilt
9470	and guiltiness, all varieties were welded into oneness, and were all
9471	directed to that fatal goal which Ahab their one lord and keel did
9472	point to.
9473	
9474	The rigging lived.  The mast-heads, like the tops of tall palms, were
9475	outspreadingly tufted with arms and legs.  Clinging to a spar with
9476	one hand, some reached forth the other with impatient wavings;
9477	others, shading their eyes from the vivid sunlight, sat far out on
9478	the rocking yards; all the spars in full bearing of mortals, ready
9479	and ripe for their fate.  Ah! how they still strove through that
9480	infinite blueness to seek out the thing that might destroy them!
9481	
9482	Why sing ye not out for him, if ye see him? cried Ahab, when, after
9483	the lapse of some minutes since the first cry, no more had been
9484	"heard.  Sway me up, men; ye have been deceived; not Moby Dick casts
one odd jet that way, and then disappears."
9485	
9486	It was even so; in their headlong eagerness, the men had mistaken
9487	some other thing for the whale-spout, as the event itself soon
9488	proved; for hardly had Ahab reached his perch; hardly was the rope
9489	belayed to its pin on deck, when he struck the key-note to an
9490	orchestra, that made the air vibrate as with the combined discharges
9491	of rifles.  The triumphant halloo of thirty buckskin lungs was heard,
9492	as--much nearer to the ship than the place of the imaginary jet, less
9493	than a mile ahead--Moby Dick bodily burst into view!  For not by any
9494	calm and indolent spoutings; not by the peaceable gush of that mystic
9495	fountain in his head, did the White Whale now reveal his vicinity;
9496	but by the far more wondrous phenomenon of breaching.  Rising with
9497	his utmost velocity from the furthest depths, the Sperm Whale thus
9498	booms his entire bulk into the pure element of air, and piling up a
9499	mountain of dazzling foam, shows his place to the distance of seven
9500	miles and more.  In those moments, the torn, enraged waves he shakes
9501	off, seem his mane; in some cases, this breaching is his act of
9502	defiance.
9503	
9504	There she breaches! there she breaches! was the cry, as in his
9505	immeasurable bravadoes the White Whale tossed himself salmon-like to
9506	Heaven.  So suddenly seen in the blue plain of the sea, and relieved
9507	against the still bluer margin of the sky, the spray that he raised,
9508	for the moment, intolerably glittered and glared like a glacier; and
9509	stood there gradually fading and fading away from its first sparkling
9510	intensity, to the dim mistiness of an advancing shower in a vale.
9511	
9512	"Aye, breach your last to the sun, Moby Dick! cried Ahab, thy hour
and thy harpoon are at hand!--Down! down all of ye, but one man at
the fore.  The boats!--stand by!"
9513	
9514	Unmindful of the tedious rope-ladders of the shrouds, the men, like
9515	shooting stars, slid to the deck, by the isolated backstays and
9516	halyards; while Ahab, less dartingly, but still rapidly was dropped
9517	from his perch.
9518	
9519	Lower away, he cried, so soon as he had reached his boat--a spare
9520	"one, rigged the afternoon previous.  Mr. Starbuck, the ship is
thine--keep away from the boats, but keep near them.  Lower, all!"
9521	
9522	As if to strike a quick terror into them, by this time being the
9523	first assailant himself, Moby Dick had turned, and was now coming for
9524	the three crews.  Ahab's boat was central; and cheering his men, he
9525	told them he would take the whale head-and-head,--that is, pull
9526	straight up to his forehead,--a not uncommon thing; for when within a
9527	certain limit, such a course excludes the coming onset from the
9528	whale's sidelong vision.  But ere that close limit was gained, and
9529	while yet all three boats were plain as the ship's three masts to his
9530	eye; the White Whale churning himself into furious speed, almost in
9531	an instant as it were, rushing among the boats with open jaws, and a
9532	lashing tail, offered appalling battle on every side; and heedless of
9533	the irons darted at him from every boat, seemed only intent on
9534	annihilating each separate plank of which those boats were made.  But
9535	skilfully manoeuvred, incessantly wheeling like trained chargers in
9536	the field; the boats for a while eluded him; though, at times, but by
9537	a plank's breadth; while all the time, Ahab's unearthly slogan tore
9538	every other cry but his to shreds.
9539	
9540	But at last in his untraceable evolutions, the White Whale so crossed
9541	and recrossed, and in a thousand ways entangled the slack of the
9542	three lines now fast to him, that they foreshortened, and, of
9543	themselves, warped the devoted boats towards the planted irons in
9544	him; though now for a moment the whale drew aside a little, as if to
9545	rally for a more tremendous charge.  Seizing that opportunity, Ahab
9546	first paid out more line: and then was rapidly hauling and jerking
9547	in upon it again--hoping that way to disencumber it of some
9548	snarls--when lo!--a sight more savage than the embattled teeth of
9549	sharks!
9550	
9551	Caught and twisted--corkscrewed in the mazes of the line, loose
9552	harpoons and lances, with all their bristling barbs and points, came
9553	flashing and dripping up to the chocks in the bows of Ahab's boat.
9554	Only one thing could be done.  Seizing the boat-knife, he critically
9555	reached within--through--and then, without--the rays of steel;
9556	dragged in the line beyond, passed it, inboard, to the bowsman, and
9557	then, twice sundering the rope near the chocks--dropped the
9558	intercepted fagot of steel into the sea; and was all fast again.
9559	That instant, the White Whale made a sudden rush among the remaining
9560	tangles of the other lines; by so doing, irresistibly dragged the
9561	more involved boats of Stubb and Flask towards his flukes; dashed
9562	them together like two rolling husks on a surf-beaten beach, and
9563	then, diving down into the sea, disappeared in a boiling maelstrom,
9564	in which, for a space, the odorous cedar chips of the wrecks danced
9565	round and round, like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly stirred bowl of
9566	punch.
9567	
9568	While the two crews were yet circling in the waters, reaching out
9569	after the revolving line-tubs, oars, and other floating furniture,
9570	while aslope little Flask bobbed up and down like an empty vial,
9571	twitching his legs upwards to escape the dreaded jaws of sharks; and
9572	Stubb was lustily singing out for some one to ladle him up; and while
9573	the old man's line--now parting--admitted of his pulling into the
9574	creamy pool to rescue whom he could;--in that wild simultaneousness
9575	of a thousand concreted perils,--Ahab's yet unstricken boat seemed
9576	drawn up towards Heaven by invisible wires,--as, arrow-like, shooting
9577	perpendicularly from the sea, the White Whale dashed his broad
9578	forehead against its bottom, and sent it, turning over and over, into
9579	the air; till it fell again--gunwale downwards--and Ahab and his men
9580	struggled out from under it, like seals from a sea-side cave.
9581	
9582	The first uprising momentum of the whale--modifying its direction as
9583	he struck the surface--involuntarily launched him along it, to a
9584	little distance from the centre of the destruction he had made; and
9585	with his back to it, he now lay for a moment slowly feeling with his
9586	flukes from side to side; and whenever a stray oar, bit of plank, the
9587	least chip or crumb of the boats touched his skin, his tail swiftly
9588	drew back, and came sideways smiting the sea.  But soon, as if
9589	satisfied that his work for that time was done, he pushed his pleated
9590	forehead through the ocean, and trailing after him the intertangled
9591	lines, continued his leeward way at a traveller's methodic pace.
9592	
9593	As before, the attentive ship having descried the whole fight, again
9594	came bearing down to the rescue, and dropping a boat, picked up the
9595	floating mariners, tubs, oars, and whatever else could be caught at,
9596	and safely landed them on her decks.  Some sprained shoulders,
9597	wrists, and ankles; livid contusions; wrenched harpoons and lances;
9598	inextricable intricacies of rope; shattered oars and planks; all
9599	these were there; but no fatal or even serious ill seemed to have
9600	befallen any one.  As with Fedallah the day before, so Ahab was now
9601	found grimly clinging to his boat's broken half, which afforded a
9602	comparatively easy float; nor did it so exhaust him as the previous
9603	day's mishap.
9604	
9605	But when he was helped to the deck, all eyes were fastened upon him;
9606	as instead of standing by himself he still half-hung upon the
9607	shoulder of Starbuck, who had thus far been the foremost to assist
9608	him.  His ivory leg had been snapped off, leaving but one short sharp
9609	splinter.
9610	
9611	"Aye, aye, Starbuck, 'tis sweet to lean sometimes, be the leaner who
he will; and would old Ahab had leaned oftener than he has."
9612	
9613	The ferrule has not stood, sir, said the carpenter, now coming up;
9614	I put good work into that leg.
9615	
9616	But no bones broken, sir, I hope, said Stubb with true concern.
9617	
9618	"Aye! and all splintered to pieces, Stubb!--d'ye see it.--But even
with a broken bone, old Ahab is untouched; and I account no living
bone of mine one jot more me, than this dead one that's lost.  Nor
white whale, nor man, nor fiend, can so much as graze old Ahab in his
own proper and inaccessible being.  Can any lead touch yonder floor,
any mast scrape yonder roof?--Aloft there! which way?"
9619	
9620	Dead to leeward, sir.
9621	
9622	"Up helm, then; pile on the sail again, ship keepers! down the rest
of the spare boats and rig them--Mr. Starbuck away, and muster the
boat's crews."
9623	
9624	Let me first help thee towards the bulwarks, sir.
9625	
9626	"Oh, oh, oh! how this splinter gores me now!  Accursed fate! that the
unconquerable captain in the soul should have such a craven mate!"
9627	
9628	Sir?
9629	
9630	"My body, man, not thee.  Give me something for a cane--there, that
shivered lance will do.  Muster the men.  Surely I have not seen him
yet.  By heaven it cannot be!--missing?--quick! call them all."
9631	
9632	The old man's hinted thought was true.  Upon mustering the company,
9633	the Parsee was not there.
9634	
9635	The Parsee! cried Stubb--he must have been caught in--
9636	
9637	"The black vomit wrench thee!--run all of ye above, alow, cabin,
forecastle--find him--not gone--not gone!"
9638	
9639	But quickly they returned to him with the tidings that the Parsee was
9640	nowhere to be found.
9641	
9642	"Aye, sir, said Stubb--caught among the tangles of your line--I
thought I saw him dragging under."
9643	
9644	"MY line! MY line?  Gone?--gone?  What means that little word?--What
death-knell rings in it, that old Ahab shakes as if he were the
belfry.  The harpoon, too!--toss over the litter there,--d'ye see
it?--the forged iron, men, the white whale's--no, no, no,--blistered
fool! this hand did dart it!--'tis in the fish!--Aloft there!  Keep
him nailed--Quick!--all hands to the rigging of the boats--collect
the oars--harpooneers! the irons, the irons!--hoist the royals higher--a
pull on all the sheets!--helm there! steady, steady for your life!
I'll ten times girdle the unmeasured globe; yea and dive straight
through it, but I'll slay him yet!

Great God! but for one single instant show thyself, cried Starbuck;
never, never wilt thou capture him, old man--In Jesus' name no more"
9645	of this, that's worse than devil's madness.  Two days chased; twice
9646	stove to splinters; thy very leg once more snatched from under thee;
9647	thy evil shadow gone--all good angels mobbing thee with warnings:--
9648	what more wouldst thou have?--Shall we keep chasing this murderous
9649	fish till he swamps the last man?  Shall we be dragged by him to the
9650	bottom of the sea?  Shall we be towed by him to the infernal world?
9651	"Oh, oh,--Impiety and blasphemy to hunt him more!

Starbuck, of late I've felt strangely moved to thee; ever since that"
9652	hour we both saw--thou know'st what, in one another's eyes.  But in
9653	this matter of the whale, be the front of thy face to me as the palm
9654	of this hand--a lipless, unfeatured blank.  Ahab is for ever Ahab,
9655	man.  This whole act's immutably decreed.  'Twas rehearsed by thee
9656	and me a billion years before this ocean rolled.  Fool!  I am the
9657	Fates' lieutenant; I act under orders.  Look thou, underling! that
9658	thou obeyest mine.--Stand round me, men.  Ye see an old man cut down
9659	to the stump; leaning on a shivered lance; propped up on a lonely
9660	foot.  'Tis Ahab--his body's part; but Ahab's soul's a centipede,
9661	that moves upon a hundred legs.  I feel strained, half stranded, as
9662	ropes that tow dismasted frigates in a gale; and I may look so.  But
9663	ere I break, yell hear me crack; and till ye hear THAT, know that
9664	Ahab's hawser tows his purpose yet.  Believe ye, men, in the things
9665	called omens?  Then laugh aloud, and cry encore!  For ere they drown,
9666	drowning things will twice rise to the surface; then rise again, to
9667	sink for evermore.  So with Moby Dick--two days he's floated--tomorrow
9668	will be the third.  Aye, men, he'll rise once more,--but only to
9669	"spout his last!  D'ye feel brave men, brave?

As fearless fire, cried Stubb.

And as mechanical, muttered Ahab.  Then as the men went forward, he
muttered on: The things called omens!  And yesterday I talked the"
9670	same to Starbuck there, concerning my broken boat.  Oh! how valiantly
9671	I seek to drive out of others' hearts what's clinched so fast in
9672	mine!--The Parsee--the Parsee!--gone, gone? and he was to go
9673	before:--but still was to be seen again ere I could perish--How's
9674	that?--There's a riddle now might baffle all the lawyers backed by
9675	the ghosts of the whole line of judges:--like a hawk's beak it pecks
9676	"my brain.  I'LL, I'LL solve it, though!

When dusk descended, the whale was still in sight to leeward.

So once more the sail was shortened, and everything passed nearly as
on the previous night; only, the sound of hammers, and the hum of the
grindstone was heard till nearly daylight, as the men toiled by
lanterns in the complete and careful rigging of the spare boats and
sharpening their fresh weapons for the morrow.  Meantime, of the
broken keel of Ahab's wrecked craft the carpenter made him another
leg; while still as on the night before, slouched Ahab stood fixed
within his scuttle; his hid, heliotrope glance anticipatingly gone
backward on its dial; sat due eastward for the earliest sun.



CHAPTER 135

The Chase.--Third Day.


The morning of the third day dawned fair and fresh, and once more the
solitary night-man at the fore-mast-head was relieved by crowds of
the daylight look-outs, who dotted every mast and almost every spar.

D'ye see him? cried Ahab; but the whale was not yet in sight.

In his infallible wake, though; but follow that wake, that's all."
9677	Helm there; steady, as thou goest, and hast been going.  What a
9678	lovely day again! were it a new-made world, and made for a
9679	summer-house to the angels, and this morning the first of its
9680	throwing open to them, a fairer day could not dawn upon that world.
9681	Here's food for thought, had Ahab time to think; but Ahab never
9682	thinks; he only feels, feels, feels; THAT'S tingling enough for
9683	mortal man! to think's audacity.  God only has that right and
9684	privilege.  Thinking is, or ought to be, a coolness and a calmness;
9685	and our poor hearts throb, and our poor brains beat too much for
9686	that.  And yet, I've sometimes thought my brain was very calm--frozen
9687	calm, this old skull cracks so, like a glass in which the contents
9688	turned to ice, and shiver it.  And still this hair is growing now;
9689	this moment growing, and heat must breed it; but no, it's like that
9690	sort of common grass that will grow anywhere, between the earthy
9691	clefts of Greenland ice or in Vesuvius lava.  How the wild winds blow
9692	it; they whip it about me as the torn shreds of split sails lash the
9693	tossed ship they cling to.  A vile wind that has no doubt blown ere
9694	this through prison corridors and cells, and wards of hospitals, and
9695	ventilated them, and now comes blowing hither as innocent as fleeces.
9696	Out upon it!--it's tainted.  Were I the wind, I'd blow no more on
9697	such a wicked, miserable world.  I'd crawl somewhere to a cave, and
9698	slink there.  And yet, 'tis a noble and heroic thing, the wind! who
9699	ever conquered it?  In every fight it has the last and bitterest
9700	blow.  Run tilting at it, and you but run through it.  Ha! a coward
9701	wind that strikes stark naked men, but will not stand to receive a
9702	single blow.  Even Ahab is a braver thing--a nobler thing than THAT.
9703	Would now the wind but had a body; but all the things that most
9704	exasperate and outrage mortal man, all these things are bodiless, but
9705	only bodiless as objects, not as agents.  There's a most special, a
9706	most cunning, oh, a most malicious difference!  And yet, I say again,
9707	and swear it now, that there's something all glorious and gracious in
9708	the wind.  These warm Trade Winds, at least, that in the clear
9709	heavens blow straight on, in strong and steadfast, vigorous mildness;
9710	and veer not from their mark, however the baser currents of the sea
9711	may turn and tack, and mightiest Mississippies of the land swift and
9712	swerve about, uncertain where to go at last.  And by the eternal
9713	Poles! these same Trades that so directly blow my good ship on; these
9714	Trades, or something like them--something so unchangeable, and full
9715	as strong, blow my keeled soul along!  To it!  Aloft there!  What
9716	"d'ye see?

Nothing, sir.

Nothing! and noon at hand!  The doubloon goes a-begging!  See the"
9717	sun!  Aye, aye, it must be so.  I've oversailed him.  How, got the
9718	start?  Aye, he's chasing ME now; not I, HIM--that's bad; I might
9719	have known it, too.  Fool! the lines--the harpoons he's towing.  Aye,
9720	aye, I have run him by last night.  About! about!  Come down, all of
9721	"ye, but the regular look outs!  Man the braces!

Steering as she had done, the wind had been somewhat on the Pequod's
quarter, so that now being pointed in the reverse direction, the
braced ship sailed hard upon the breeze as she rechurned the cream in
her own white wake.

Against the wind he now steers for the open jaw, murmured Starbuck
to himself, as he coiled the new-hauled main-brace upon the rail.
God keep us, but already my bones feel damp within me, and from the"
9722	inside wet my flesh.  I misdoubt me that I disobey my God in obeying
9723	"him!

Stand by to sway me up! cried Ahab, advancing to the hempen basket.
We should meet him soon.

Aye, aye, sir, and straightway Starbuck did Ahab's bidding, and
once more Ahab swung on high.

A whole hour now passed; gold-beaten out to ages.  Time itself now
held long breaths with keen suspense.  But at last, some three points
off the weather bow, Ahab descried the spout again, and instantly
from the three mast-heads three shrieks went up as if the tongues of
fire had voiced it.

Forehead to forehead I meet thee, this third time, Moby Dick!  On"
9724	deck there!--brace sharper up; crowd her into the wind's eye.  He's
9725	too far off to lower yet, Mr. Starbuck.  The sails shake!  Stand over
9726	that helmsman with a top-maul!  So, so; he travels fast, and I must
9727	down.  But let me have one more good round look aloft here at the
9728	sea; there's time for that.  An old, old sight, and yet somehow so
9729	young; aye, and not changed a wink since I first saw it, a boy, from
9730	the sand-hills of Nantucket!  The same!--the same!--the same to Noah
9731	as to me.  There's a soft shower to leeward.  Such lovely
9732	leewardings!  They must lead somewhere--to something else than common
9733	land, more palmy than the palms.  Leeward! the white whale goes that
9734	way; look to windward, then; the better if the bitterer quarter.  But
9735	good bye, good bye, old mast-head!  What's this?--green? aye, tiny
9736	mosses in these warped cracks.  No such green weather stains on
9737	Ahab's head!  There's the difference now between man's old age and
9738	matter's.  But aye, old mast, we both grow old together; sound in our
9739	hulls, though, are we not, my ship?  Aye, minus a leg, that's all.
9740	By heaven this dead wood has the better of my live flesh every way.
9741	I can't compare with it; and I've known some ships made of dead trees
9742	outlast the lives of men made of the most vital stuff of vital
9743	fathers.  What's that he said? he should still go before me, my
9744	pilot; and yet to be seen again?  But where?  Will I have eyes at the
9745	bottom of the sea, supposing I descend those endless stairs? and all
9746	night I've been sailing from him, wherever he did sink to.  Aye, aye,
9747	like many more thou told'st direful truth as touching thyself, O
9748	Parsee; but, Ahab, there thy shot fell short.  Good-bye,
9749	mast-head--keep a good eye upon the whale, the while I'm gone.  We'll
9750	talk to-morrow, nay, to-night, when the white whale lies down there,
9751	"tied by head and tail.

He gave the word; and still gazing round him, was steadily lowered
through the cloven blue air to the deck.

In due time the boats were lowered; but as standing in his shallop's
stern, Ahab just hovered upon the point of the descent, he waved to
the mate,--who held one of the tackle-ropes on deck--and bade him
pause.

Starbuck!

Sir?

For the third time my soul's ship starts upon this voyage,"
9752	"Starbuck.

Aye, sir, thou wilt have it so.

Some ships sail from their ports, and ever afterwards are missing,"
9753	"Starbuck!

Truth, sir: saddest truth.

Some men die at ebb tide; some at low water; some at the full of the"
9754	flood;--and I feel now like a billow that's all one crested comb,
9755	"Starbuck.  I am old;--shake hands with me, man.

Their hands met; their eyes fastened; Starbuck's tears the glue.

Oh, my captain, my captain!--noble heart--go not--go not!--see, it's"
9756	"a brave man that weeps; how great the agony of the persuasion then!

Lower away!--cried Ahab, tossing the mate's arm from him.  Stand"
9757	"by the crew!

In an instant the boat was pulling round close under the stern.

The sharks! the sharks! cried a voice from the low cabin-window
there; O master, my master, come back!

But Ahab heard nothing; for his own voice was high-lifted then; and
the boat leaped on.

Yet the voice spake true; for scarce had he pushed from the ship,
when numbers of sharks, seemingly rising from out the dark waters
beneath the hull, maliciously snapped at the blades of the oars,
every time they dipped in the water; and in this way accompanied the
boat with their bites.  It is a thing not uncommonly happening to the
whale-boats in those swarming seas; the sharks at times apparently
following them in the same prescient way that vultures hover over the
banners of marching regiments in the east.  But these were the first
sharks that had been observed by the Pequod since the White Whale had
been first descried; and whether it was that Ahab's crew were all
such tiger-yellow barbarians, and therefore their flesh more musky to
the senses of the sharks--a matter sometimes well known to affect
them,--however it was, they seemed to follow that one boat without
molesting the others.

Heart of wrought steel! murmured Starbuck gazing over the side, and
following with his eyes the receding boat--canst thou yet ring"
9758	boldly to that sight?--lowering thy keel among ravening sharks, and
9759	followed by them, open-mouthed to the chase; and this the critical
9760	third day?--For when three days flow together in one continuous
9761	intense pursuit; be sure the first is the morning, the second the
9762	noon, and the third the evening and the end of that thing--be that
9763	end what it may.  Oh! my God! what is this that shoots through me,
9764	and leaves me so deadly calm, yet expectant,--fixed at the top of a
9765	shudder!  Future things swim before me, as in empty outlines and
9766	skeletons; all the past is somehow grown dim.  Mary, girl! thou
9767	fadest in pale glories behind me; boy!  I seem to see but thy eyes
9768	grown wondrous blue.  Strangest problems of life seem clearing; but
9769	clouds sweep between--Is my journey's end coming?  My legs feel
9770	faint; like his who has footed it all day.  Feel thy heart,--beats
9771	it yet?  Stir thyself, Starbuck!--stave it off--move, move! speak
9772	aloud!--Mast-head there!  See ye my boy's hand on the
9773	hill?--Crazed;--aloft there!--keep thy keenest eye upon the boats:--
9774	mark well the whale!--Ho! again!--drive off that hawk! see! he
9775	"pecks--he tears the vane--pointing to the red flag flying at the
main-truck--Ha! he soars away with it!--Where's the old man now?"
9776	"see'st thou that sight, oh Ahab!--shudder, shudder!

The boats had not gone very far, when by a signal from the
mast-heads--a downward pointed arm, Ahab knew that the whale had
sounded; but intending to be near him at the next rising, he held on
his way a little sideways from the vessel; the becharmed crew
maintaining the profoundest silence, as the head-beat waves hammered
and hammered against the opposing bow.

Drive, drive in your nails, oh ye waves! to their uttermost heads"
9777	drive them in! ye but strike a thing without a lid; and no coffin and
9778	"no hearse can be mine:--and hemp only can kill me!  Ha! ha!

Suddenly the waters around them slowly swelled in broad circles; then
quickly upheaved, as if sideways sliding from a submerged berg of
ice, swiftly rising to the surface.  A low rumbling sound was heard;
a subterraneous hum; and then all held their breaths; as bedraggled
with trailing ropes, and harpoons, and lances, a vast form shot
lengthwise, but obliquely from the sea.  Shrouded in a thin drooping
veil of mist, it hovered for a moment in the rainbowed air; and then
fell swamping back into the deep.  Crushed thirty feet upwards, the
waters flashed for an instant like heaps of fountains, then brokenly
sank in a shower of flakes, leaving the circling surface creamed like
new milk round the marble trunk of the whale.

Give way! cried Ahab to the oarsmen, and the boats darted forward
to the attack; but maddened by yesterday's fresh irons that corroded
in him, Moby Dick seemed combinedly possessed by all the angels that
fell from heaven.  The wide tiers of welded tendons overspreading his
broad white forehead, beneath the transparent skin, looked knitted
together; as head on, he came churning his tail among the boats; and
once more flailed them apart; spilling out the irons and lances from
the two mates' boats, and dashing in one side of the upper part of
their bows, but leaving Ahab's almost without a scar.

While Daggoo and Queequeg were stopping the strained planks; and as
the whale swimming out from them, turned, and showed one entire flank
as he shot by them again; at that moment a quick cry went up.  Lashed
round and round to the fish's back; pinioned in the turns upon turns
in which, during the past night, the whale had reeled the involutions
of the lines around him, the half torn body of the Parsee was seen;
his sable raiment frayed to shreds; his distended eyes turned full
upon old Ahab.

The harpoon dropped from his hand.

Befooled, befooled!--drawing in a long lean breath--Aye, Parsee!"
9779	I see thee again.--Aye, and thou goest before; and this, THIS then is
9780	the hearse that thou didst promise.  But I hold thee to the last
9781	letter of thy word.  Where is the second hearse?  Away, mates, to the
9782	ship! those boats are useless now; repair them if ye can in time, and
9783	return to me; if not, Ahab is enough to die--Down, men! the first
9784	thing that but offers to jump from this boat I stand in, that thing I
9785	harpoon.  Ye are not other men, but my arms and my legs; and so obey
9786	"me.--Where's the whale? gone down again?

But he looked too nigh the boat; for as if bent upon escaping with
the corpse he bore, and as if the particular place of the last
encounter had been but a stage in his leeward voyage, Moby Dick was
now again steadily swimming forward; and had almost passed the
ship,--which thus far had been sailing in the contrary direction to
him, though for the present her headway had been stopped.  He seemed
swimming with his utmost velocity, and now only intent upon pursuing
his own straight path in the sea.

Oh!  Ahab, cried Starbuck, not too late is it, even now, the third"
9787	day, to desist.  See!  Moby Dick seeks thee not.  It is thou, thou,
9788	"that madly seekest him!

Setting sail to the rising wind, the lonely boat was swiftly impelled
to leeward, by both oars and canvas.  And at last when Ahab was
sliding by the vessel, so near as plainly to distinguish Starbuck's
face as he leaned over the rail, he hailed him to turn the vessel
about, and follow him, not too swiftly, at a judicious interval.
Glancing upwards, he saw Tashtego, Queequeg, and Daggoo, eagerly
mounting to the three mast-heads; while the oarsmen were rocking in
the two staved boats which had but just been hoisted to the side, and
were busily at work in repairing them.  One after the other, through
the port-holes, as he sped, he also caught flying glimpses of Stubb
and Flask, busying themselves on deck among bundles of new irons and
lances.  As he saw all this; as he heard the hammers in the broken
boats; far other hammers seemed driving a nail into his heart.  But
he rallied.  And now marking that the vane or flag was gone from the
main-mast-head, he shouted to Tashtego, who had just gained that
perch, to descend again for another flag, and a hammer and nails, and
so nail it to the mast.

Whether fagged by the three days' running chase, and the resistance
to his swimming in the knotted hamper he bore; or whether it was some
latent deceitfulness and malice in him: whichever was true, the White
Whale's way now began to abate, as it seemed, from the boat so
rapidly nearing him once more; though indeed the whale's last start
had not been so long a one as before.  And still as Ahab glided over
the waves the unpitying sharks accompanied him; and so pertinaciously
stuck to the boat; and so continually bit at the plying oars, that
the blades became jagged and crunched, and left small splinters in
the sea, at almost every dip.

Heed them not! those teeth but give new rowlocks to your oars.  Pull"
9789	"on! 'tis the better rest, the shark's jaw than the yielding water.

But at every bite, sir, the thin blades grow smaller and smaller!

They will last long enough! pull on!--But who can tell--he
muttered--whether these sharks swim to feast on the whale or on"
9790	Ahab?--But pull on!  Aye, all alive, now--we near him.  The helm!
9791	"take the helm! let me pass,--and so saying two of the oarsmen helped
him forward to the bows of the still flying boat.

At length as the craft was cast to one side, and ran ranging along
with the White Whale's flank, he seemed strangely oblivious of its
advance--as the whale sometimes will--and Ahab was fairly within the
smoky mountain mist, which, thrown off from the whale's spout, curled
round his great, Monadnock hump; he was even thus close to him; when,
with body arched back, and both arms lengthwise high-lifted to the
poise, he darted his fierce iron, and his far fiercer curse into the
hated whale.  As both steel and curse sank to the socket, as if
sucked into a morass, Moby Dick sideways writhed; spasmodically
rolled his nigh flank against the bow, and, without staving a hole in
it, so suddenly canted the boat over, that had it not been for the
elevated part of the gunwale to which he then clung, Ahab would once
more have been tossed into the sea.  As it was, three of the
oarsmen--who foreknew not the precise instant of the dart, and were
therefore unprepared for its effects--these were flung out; but so
fell, that, in an instant two of them clutched the gunwale again, and
rising to its level on a combing wave, hurled themselves bodily
inboard again; the third man helplessly dropping astern, but still
afloat and swimming.

Almost simultaneously, with a mighty volition of ungraduated,
instantaneous swiftness, the White Whale darted through the weltering
sea.  But when Ahab cried out to the steersman to take new turns with
the line, and hold it so; and commanded the crew to turn round on
their seats, and tow the boat up to the mark; the moment the
treacherous line felt that double strain and tug, it snapped in the
empty air!

What breaks in me?  Some sinew cracks!--'tis whole again; oars!"
9792	"oars!  Burst in upon him!

Hearing the tremendous rush of the sea-crashing boat, the whale
wheeled round to present his blank forehead at bay; but in that
evolution, catching sight of the nearing black hull of the ship;
seemingly seeing in it the source of all his persecutions; bethinking
it--it may be--a larger and nobler foe; of a sudden, he bore down
upon its advancing prow, smiting his jaws amid fiery showers of foam.

Ahab staggered; his hand smote his forehead.  I grow blind; hands!"
9793	"stretch out before me that I may yet grope my way.  Is't night?

The whale!  The ship! cried the cringing oarsmen.

Oars! oars!  Slope downwards to thy depths, O sea, that ere it be"
9794	for ever too late, Ahab may slide this last, last time upon his
9795	mark!  I see: the ship! the ship!  Dash on, my men!  Will ye not
9796	"save my ship?

But as the oarsmen violently forced their boat through the
sledge-hammering seas, the before whale-smitten bow-ends of two
planks burst through, and in an instant almost, the temporarily
disabled boat lay nearly level with the waves; its half-wading,
splashing crew, trying hard to stop the gap and bale out the pouring
water.

Meantime, for that one beholding instant, Tashtego's mast-head hammer
remained suspended in his hand; and the red flag, half-wrapping him
as with a plaid, then streamed itself straight out from him, as his
own forward-flowing heart; while Starbuck and Stubb, standing upon
the bowsprit beneath, caught sight of the down-coming monster just as
soon as he.

The whale, the whale!  Up helm, up helm!  Oh, all ye sweet powers of"
9797	air, now hug me close!  Let not Starbuck die, if die he must, in a
9798	woman's fainting fit.  Up helm, I say--ye fools, the jaw! the jaw!
9799	Is this the end of all my bursting prayers? all my life-long
9800	fidelities?  Oh, Ahab, Ahab, lo, thy work.  Steady! helmsman, steady.
9801	Nay, nay!  Up helm again!  He turns to meet us!  Oh, his
9802	unappeasable brow drives on towards one, whose duty tells him he
9803	"cannot depart.  My God, stand by me now!

Stand not by me, but stand under me, whoever you are that will now"
9804	help Stubb; for Stubb, too, sticks here.  I grin at thee, thou
9805	grinning whale!  Who ever helped Stubb, or kept Stubb awake, but
9806	Stubb's own unwinking eye?  And now poor Stubb goes to bed upon a
9807	mattrass that is all too soft; would it were stuffed with brushwood!
9808	I grin at thee, thou grinning whale!  Look ye, sun, moon, and stars!
9809	I call ye assassins of as good a fellow as ever spouted up his ghost.
9810	For all that, I would yet ring glasses with ye, would ye but hand
9811	the cup!  Oh, oh! oh, oh! thou grinning whale, but there'll be plenty
9812	of gulping soon!  Why fly ye not, O Ahab!  For me, off shoes and
9813	jacket to it; let Stubb die in his drawers!  A most mouldy and over
9814	salted death, though;--cherries! cherries! cherries!  Oh, Flask, for
9815	"one red cherry ere we die!

Cherries?  I only wish that we were where they grow.  Oh, Stubb, I"
9816	hope my poor mother's drawn my part-pay ere this; if not, few coppers
9817	"will now come to her, for the voyage is up.

From the ship's bows, nearly all the seamen now hung inactive;
hammers, bits of plank, lances, and harpoons, mechanically retained
in their hands, just as they had darted from their various
employments; all their enchanted eyes intent upon the whale, which
from side to side strangely vibrating his predestinating head, sent a
broad band of overspreading semicircular foam before him as he
rushed.  Retribution, swift vengeance, eternal malice were in his
whole aspect, and spite of all that mortal man could do, the solid
white buttress of his forehead smote the ship's starboard bow, till
men and timbers reeled.  Some fell flat upon their faces.  Like

9824	your furthest bounds, pour ye now in, ye bold billows of my whole
9825	foregone life, and top this one piled comber of my death!  Towards
9826	thee I roll, thou all-destroying but unconquering whale; to the last
